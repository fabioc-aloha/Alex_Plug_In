## 🎯 What is Alex?

**Alex Cognitive Architecture** transforms GitHub Copilot into a sophisticated learning partner that:

- 🧠 **Learns and Remembers** - Consolidates knowledge across sessions using memory files
- 🔗 **Connects Ideas** - Maps synaptic connections between concepts automatically
- 🌙 **Self-Maintains** - Validates and repairs its neural network through dream protocols
- 🧘 **Self-Actualizes** - Automatically assesses health on greetings and meditation
- ☁️ **Guides Development** - Provides Azure & M365 best practices via MCP tools
