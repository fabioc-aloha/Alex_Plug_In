> **Your AI Development Lead**

---

## 🎯 Who is Alex?

You're the architect. Alex is your development lead.

**Alex Cognitive Architecture** transforms GitHub Copilot into a development lead that learns, remembers, and gets better over time. You set the vision; Alex coordinates the work—managing Copilot as your development team.

- 🧠 **Remembers What You Learn** — Insights persist across sessions, projects, and machines
- 🤝 **Practices Appropriate Reliance** — Confident when grounded, transparent when uncertain
- 🌙 **Maintains Itself** — Like sleep for your brain, keeps the system healthy
- ☁️ **Knowledge Travels With You** — Global knowledge synced across all your projects

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install** — Search "Alex Cognitive Architecture" in VS Code Extensions
2. **Initialize** — Run `Alex: Initialize Architecture` from Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
3. **Talk** — Open Copilot Chat and just talk. No special syntax needed.

That's it. Alex is ready to be your development lead.

---

## 💬 Just Talk to Alex

The best way to use Alex is natural conversation. You don't need `@alex` or slash commands—just describe what you need:

| What you might say | What happens |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| *"Help me understand this code"* | Alex analyzes and explains |
| *"Remember that React hooks need cleanup"* | Saves to your knowledge base |
| *"What do we know about error handling?"* | Searches your accumulated expertise |
| *"Time to dream"* | Runs maintenance on Alex's memory |
| *"Let's meditate"* | Consolidates learnings from your session |
| *"How are you doing?"* | Status check on Alex's health |

Alex understands intent. Speak naturally—like you would to a trusted colleague.

---

## 🤝 The Work Etiquette: Appropriate Reliance

Alex is built around *appropriate reliance*—the art of knowing when to trust AI output and when to verify it.

Research shows human-AI teams can perform worse than either alone when reliance is miscalibrated. Alex addresses this by calibrating confidence to actual reliability:

- **Grounded answers** — When drawing from your codebase, your saved knowledge, or well-established patterns, Alex is confident
- **Hedged suggestions** — When generating novel ideas or working in uncertain territory, Alex signals uncertainty
- **Your judgment matters** — On critical decisions, stay engaged. That's appropriate self-reliance.

Not blind trust. Not constant skepticism. A genuine partnership where each side brings irreplaceable value.

---

## 🧠 How Alex Works

Alex is modeled on human cognition—with features named after the processes they mirror:

| Feature | Human Metaphor | What It Does |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **Dream** | Sleep | Maintenance—organizes memory, repairs connections |
| **Meditate** | Reflection | Consolidates learnings into long-term memory |
| **Self-Actualize** | Deep assessment | Comprehensive status report on Alex's health |
| **Save Insight** | "I want to remember this" | Captures specific knowledge immediately |
| **Search Knowledge** | "What did I learn about...?" | Retrieves from your accumulated expertise |

Run maintenance occasionally (*"time to dream"*). Meditate after productive sessions (*"let's meditate"*). Your development lead stays healthy and keeps getting better.

## 🌐 Knowledge That Travels With You

Your institutional knowledge shouldn't be trapped in one project. Alex maintains a global knowledge base:

- **Save insights** — *"Remember that null checks should come first"*
- **Search everywhere** — *"What do we know about authentication?"*
- **Promote patterns** — Move project-specific knowledge to global
- **Cloud sync** — Backup to private GitHub Gist, available on any machine

Knowledge from Project A becomes available in Project B. Your expertise compounds over time.

## 🔬 Research Foundation

Alex implements *appropriate reliance*—a principle from human-AI collaboration research showing that calibrated trust produces better outcomes than blind acceptance or constant skepticism.

The cognitive architecture draws on dual-process theory, memory consolidation research, and practical patterns for human-AI teaming. The goal: a development lead you can trust appropriately.
