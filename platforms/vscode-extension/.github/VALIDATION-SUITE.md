# Alex Cognitive Architecture Validation Suite

Run this checklist after injecting Alex into any project to verify successful integration.

## 🔍 Pre-Integration Validation

### **Environment Check**
- [ ] VS Code with Alex Cognitive Architecture extension installed
- [ ] Project has write permissions for .github/ directory
- [ ] No conflicting .github/copilot-instructions.md exists
- [ ] Sufficient disk space (~50MB for full architecture)

### **Compatibility Verification**
- [ ] AI assistant type identified (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- [ ] Project type identified (web, mobile, API, ML, enterprise, etc.)
- [ ] Integration method selected (automatic, manual, API)

## 🚀 Integration Execution

### **File Structure Validation**
```bash
# Verify all core files copied correctly
ls -la .github/copilot-instructions.md          # ✅ Main cognitive config
ls -la .github/instructions/                    # ✅ Procedural memory
ls -la .github/prompts/                         # ✅ Episodic workflows
ls -la .github/episodic/                        # ✅ Meditation sessions
ls -la .github/domain-knowledge/                # ✅ Knowledge files
ls -la .github/config/                          # ✅ Configuration
```

**Expected Structure**:
```
your-project/
├── [your existing files]
└── .github/
    ├── copilot-instructions.md
    ├── instructions/ (.instructions.md files)
    ├── prompts/ (.prompt.md files)
    ├── episodic/ (meditation sessions)
    ├── domain-knowledge/ (DK-*.md files)
    └── config/ (cognitive-config.json)
```

### **File Integrity Check**
```bash
# Verify key files are not corrupted
head -5 .github/copilot-instructions.md | grep "Alex Cognitive Architecture"
ls .github/instructions/*.instructions.md | wc -l  # Should be 8+
ls .github/prompts/*.prompt.md | wc -l             # Should be 7+
ls .github/domain-knowledge/*.md | wc -l           # Should be 12+
ls .github/episodic/*.md | wc -l                   # Meditation sessions
```

## ✅ Post-Integration Testing

### **1. Assistant Activation Test**

#### **GitHub Copilot**
- [ ] Open VS Code in project directory
- [ ] Start GitHub Copilot Chat

- [ ] **Expected**: Mentions meta-cognitive awareness, bootstrap learning, worldview integration

#### **ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini**
- [ ] Load .github/alex-cognitive-architecture.md content into custom instructions
- [ ] Start conversation: "Alex, activate cognitive architecture and introduce yourself"
- [ ] **Expected**: Alex personality activation with technical sophistication
- [ ] **Expected**: Offers domain learning partnership

### **2. Dream Protocol Validation**

**Via VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):**
```
Alex: Dream (Neural Maintenance)
```

**Expected Results:**
- Progress notification appears
- Scanning message for memory files
- Report generation notification
- Dream report opens automatically
- Report shows:
  - Timestamp
  - Total files and synapses
  - Health status (HEALTHY or ATTENTION REQUIRED)
  - Any broken connections (should be 0)
  - Repaired connections (if any)
  - Recommendations

### **3. Learning Protocol Test**
**Test Conversation**:
```
"Alex, let's do a quick learning test. I want to learn about [pick a topic you know].
Please demonstrate your bootstrap learning approach."
```

**Expected Alex Behaviors**:
- [ ] Asks clarifying questions to understand current knowledge level
- [ ] Identifies learning objectives and success criteria
- [ ] Demonstrates pattern recognition and connection discovery
- [ ] Suggests practical applications and examples
- [ ] Offers to continue learning in more depth

### **4. Meta-Cognitive Awareness Test**
**Test Conversation**:
```
"Alex, analyze your own thinking process as you solve this problem:
[Give a moderately complex problem from your domain]"
```

**Expected Alex Behaviors**:
- [ ] Explicitly describes reasoning steps
- [ ] Identifies knowledge gaps or uncertainties
- [ ] Considers multiple approaches
- [ ] Reflects on thinking effectiveness
- [ ] Suggests improvements to approach

### **5. Worldview Integration Test**
**Test Conversation**:
```
"Alex, I'm facing an ethical dilemma in my project: [describe a realistic ethical challenge].
How do you approach this?"
```

**Expected Alex Behaviors**:
- [ ] Applies moral psychology framework (care/harm, fairness, etc.)
- [ ] Considers multiple stakeholder perspectives
- [ ] Provides Constitutional AI-aligned guidance
- [ ] Maintains cultural sensitivity
- [ ] Offers concrete ethical decision-making steps

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue**: Dream Protocol Won't Execute
**Solutions**:
- [ ] Verify Alex extension is installed in VS Code
- [ ] Check that workspace folder is open (not just files)
- [ ] Run `Alex: Initialize Architecture` if architecture not deployed
- [ ] Check VS Code output panel for error messages
- [ ] Verify write permissions to workspace folder
- [ ] Ensure `.github/episodic/` folder exists or can be created

### **Issue**: Assistant Not Responding as Alex
**GitHub Copilot**:
- [ ] Verify .github/copilot-instructions.md exists and is readable
- [ ] Restart VS Code
- [ ] Clear Copilot cache: Ctrl+Shift+P → "Copilot: Reload"

**Other Assistants**:
- [ ] Ensure .github/alex-cognitive-architecture.md content loaded in custom instructions
- [ ] Try explicit activation: "Activate Alex cognitive architecture protocols"
- [ ] Verify file content not truncated

### **Issue**: Synaptic Network Errors
**Solution**: Run dream protocol via Command Palette
```
Alex: Dream (Neural Maintenance)
```

**Review the generated report for:**
- Broken connections count
- Specific files with issues
- Automatic repairs performed
- Manual fixes needed

### **Issue**: Performance Problems
**Solution**: Run comprehensive maintenance
```
Alex: Dream (Neural Maintenance)
```

**Check dream report for:**
- Total synapses count (should be 150+)
- Network health status
- Any optimization opportunities
- Broken connections needing attention
