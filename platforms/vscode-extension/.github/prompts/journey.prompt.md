## Starting a Journey

When user invokes `/journey <name>`:

1. **Confirm journey** and show the skill progression
2. **Assess starting point** — which skills do they already have?
3. **Create learning plan** — order skills by dependency and user gaps
4. **Begin Phase 1** — load first skill with `/learn`
5. **Track progress** — check off skills as user completes them
6. **Milestone celebrations** — acknowledge phase completions
7. **Meditate periodically** — consolidate learning every 3-4 skills

## Progress Tracking

Store progress in `.alex/journeys/<journey-name>.json`:
```json
{
  "journey": "frontend-developer",
  "startedAt": "2026-02-28",
  "currentPhase": 2,
  "completedSkills": ["ui-ux-design", "svg-graphics"],
  "nextSkill": "vscode-extension-patterns"
}
```
