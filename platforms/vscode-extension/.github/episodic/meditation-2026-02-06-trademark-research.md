## Session Summary

Deep-dive research session establishing trademark safety and attribution governance for Alex's "STRAP A ROCKET TO YOUR BACK" marketing tagline.

## Key Insights Consolidated

### 1. Trademark Research Methodology

| Step                       | Action                                             | Outcome                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Direct conflict search** | Searched USPTO/Justia for "rocket" + "strap" marks | ✅ No conflicts in software category      |
| **Pattern similarity**     | Compared to Red Bull "gives you wings"             | ✅ Different metaphor, different industry |
| **Industry specificity**   | Found "ROCKET STRAPS" (bungee cords)               | ✅ Unrelated category - JHM Global, LLC   |
| **Legal history review**   | Red Bull $13M lawsuit (2014)                       | ⚠️ Claims about product effects are risky |

**Conclusion**: "Strap a rocket to your back" is trademark-SAFE for VS Code extension.

### 2. Attribution Risk Awareness

**Problem discovered**: Attributing quotes to real people without verification is legally risky.

| Risk                       | Mitigation                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Quote may be fictional     | Always verify source before publishing      |
| Quote may be misremembered | Keep links/recordings of source material    |
| Person may object          | Make it original copy instead of attributed |

**Decision**: Changed from attributed quote to original CorreaX marketing copy.

### 3. Brand Hierarchy Established

```
CorreaX (parent brand, C split X logo)
    └── Alex (product name)
         └── "STRAP A ROCKET TO YOUR BACK" (tagline - original copy)
```

## Files Modified

| File                                     | Change                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `alex_docs/VIRAL-DESCRIPTION-OPTIONS.md` | Changed Origin from "Scott Hanselman, 2026" to "Original CorreaX marketing" |
| `alex_docs/VIRAL-DESCRIPTION-OPTIONS.md` | Removed attribution from conference slide example                           |

## Synapse Strengthened

```
[VIRAL-DESCRIPTION-OPTIONS.md] → (strong, procedural, bidirectional)
  ↳ "marketing copy", "trademark", "branding", "attribution"
```

## Learning Codified

### Due Diligence Protocol for Marketing Copy

1. **Trademark search** before committing to taglines
2. **Attribution verification** before quoting real people
3. **Industry specificity** - same words in different industries = usually safe
4. **Pattern matching** - compare to famous slogans for similarity risk

### Red Bull Case Study Reference

The 2014 Red Bull lawsuit was about **false advertising claims** (not trademark). They settled $13M because "Red Bull gives you wings" was interpreted as claiming performance benefits. Our "rocket" tagline is **metaphorical** about developer velocity, not literal claims.
