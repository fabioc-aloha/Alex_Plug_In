## Key Learning: Heir Consolidation Pattern

When heirs experiment, they create **granular skills** for each capability. During Master promotion:

1. **Identify Overlaps**: Look for skills that serve the same domain
2. **Choose Anchor**: Select the most comprehensive skill as target
3. **Merge Content**: Absorb related skills into anchor
4. **Update Catalogs**: Document the merge for traceability

**Anti-pattern**: Promoting every heir skill as-is leads to skill sprawl (many small skills > fewer comprehensive skills)
