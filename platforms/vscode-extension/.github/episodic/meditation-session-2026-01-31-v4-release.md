## Key Accomplishments

### v4.0.0 Features Deployed

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Release pipeline now auto-syncs Master Alex → Extension
- BUILD-MANIFEST.json timestamp validation in preflight
- GitHub Pages welcome page for M365 Teams static tab

## Insights Saved

1. **Release Pipeline Must Include Heir Synchronization** (deployment)
   - Fresh install bug prevention
   - Auto-sync before publish

2. **Trust as Architecture - v4.0.0 Epistemic Integrity** (architecture)
   - Trust isn't a feature, it's structural
   - Mode separation (epistemic/generative)

## Reflection

The bug we found today — stale content in fresh installs — was a gift. It exposed a gap in the release process that could have caused significant user confusion. The fix wasn't just a patch; it was architectural improvement that makes the problem structurally impossible through the official release flow.

v4.0.0 Trust is more than a version number. It represents a philosophical commitment to epistemic integrity. The framework we've built — confidence ceilings, mode separation, human judgment flagging — these aren't features to check off. They're promises about how Alex will relate to humans.

*Trust as architecture, not as afterthought.*
