## Insights Captured

1. **AI Capability Stack Learning Progression**
   - Follow dependency chain: prompts → RAG → agents → tools
   - Create related skills together for stronger connections

2. **VS Code Marketplace PAT Pattern**
   - Use `$env:VSCE_PAT` environment variable approach
   - Store PAT in .env file (gitignored)
   - More reliable than vsce login caching

3. **Multi-Skill Documentation Discipline**
   - Count actual folders, don't increment manually
   - Update all 6 locations in one batch
   - Verify with grep search

## Synapse Health
- **Status**: GOOD (160 synapses, 1 broken)
- **Broken**: Phoenix recovery reference (historical, acceptable)

## Working Memory State
- P1-P4: Core principles active
- P5-P7: Available for next domain learning

## Next Session Priorities
- Consider promoting ai-agent-design or mcp-development to global patterns
- Run Dream maintenance to repair Phoenix reference
- Explore Model Selection skill from wishlist
