# 🧠 How Alex Thinks

> Understanding your development lead's cognitive model

---

## The Big Picture

Alex is designed to think like a skilled lead developer—one who learns, remembers, and keeps getting better. This isn't just a metaphor; the architecture is modeled on how human cognition actually works.

You've probably noticed that Alex has features called "Dream," "Meditate," and "Self-Actualize." Those names come from the cognitive processes they mirror. Understanding the model helps you work with Alex more effectively.

## Two Modes of Thinking

Alex operates in two complementary modes, inspired by cognitive psychology's "dual-process theory."

**Fast, Automatic Processing** handles routine tasks in the background. You don't have to ask—Alex just handles it. This includes syncing your knowledge to the cloud, detecting patterns worth remembering, and searching global knowledge when local search comes up empty. It's like how an experienced lead handles routine decisions without bothering you.

**Slow, Deliberate Processing** kicks in when you explicitly engage. When you ask Alex to meditate on a session, analyze a complex problem, or teach you something new, Alex shifts into focused mode—gathering context, reasoning carefully, and producing thoughtful responses. This is like when you pull your lead into a meeting to work through something important together.

The balance matters. Fast processing keeps things efficient. Slow processing ensures quality on things that matter. A good lead knows when to use which mode—and so does Alex.

## Memory That Persists

Unlike most AI tools that forget everything when you close the window, Alex remembers.

**Working Memory** is what Alex holds during a conversation—like a developer's mental context while solving a problem. It's limited (roughly 7 active concepts at a time, just like human working memory) and clears between sessions.

**Long-Term Memory** is where valuable knowledge goes to stick around. When you have an insight worth keeping, Alex can store it in files that persist across sessions, projects, and machines. This includes:

- **Procedural knowledge**: How to do things (processes, workflows, checklists)
- **Episodic knowledge**: Complex multi-step operations (like meditation protocols)
- **Domain knowledge**: Expertise in specific areas (React patterns, API design, your codebase)
- **Global knowledge**: Insights that apply everywhere, synced across all your projects

Think of it like how a lead developer builds institutional knowledge over years—except Alex can do it in weeks, and the knowledge is explicitly documented rather than just in someone's head.

## Learning and Consolidation

Human brains consolidate memories during sleep and reflection. Alex does something similar.

**Dream** is maintenance mode—Alex checks that all memories are properly organized and connections are intact. It's like getting good sleep: not glamorous, but essential for staying sharp.

**Meditate** is reflection mode—Alex reviews what happened in a session and decides what's worth keeping long-term. This is how temporary working memory becomes permanent knowledge.

**Self-Actualize** is deep assessment mode—Alex does a thorough inventory of its own state, identifying what's working well and what needs attention.

These aren't just features; they're how the cognitive architecture stays healthy and keeps improving.

## Appropriate Reliance Built In

The entire architecture is designed around appropriate reliance—the principle that good collaboration requires calibrated trust.

Alex tracks where knowledge comes from. When answering based on your codebase or your saved insights, Alex can be confident. When generating novel ideas or working from general patterns, Alex hedges appropriately. This source-grounding is built into the architecture, not bolted on.

The goal is a lead you can trust: confident when confidence is warranted, transparent when uncertainty exists, always oriented toward making you more effective rather than dependent.

## Why This Matters for You

Understanding Alex's cognitive model helps you:

**Use the right interaction style.** For quick tasks, just ask. For important learning you want to keep, explicitly save insights or run meditation. For deep work, engage deliberately.

**Maintain the system.** Running "dream" occasionally keeps things healthy. It's not overhead; it's how the architecture stays effective.

**Trust appropriately.** When Alex expresses confidence, it's grounded. When Alex hedges, pay attention. The cognitive model is designed to give you accurate signals.

You're the architect. Alex is your lead. The cognitive architecture is what makes that partnership actually work.
