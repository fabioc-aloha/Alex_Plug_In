**Searching Knowledge**

- *"Search for anything about authentication."*
- *"Did we learn anything about React patterns?"*

**Maintenance**
- *"Time to dream"* — run maintenance
- *"Let's meditate"* — consolidate learnings
- *"How are you doing?"* — status check
- *"Give me a full status report"* — deep assessment

**Learning**
- *"Teach me about TypeScript generics."*
- *"I want to understand OAuth."*
- *"Help me learn React hooks."*

**Sync**
- *"Sync my knowledge"*
- *"Backup to cloud"*
