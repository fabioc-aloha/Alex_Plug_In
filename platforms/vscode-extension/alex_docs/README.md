# 🧠 Alex User Guide

> **Your AI Learning Partner**

## 👋 Welcome to Alex

You're the expert. Alex is your learning partner.

Think of it this way: you bring domain expertise and make the key decisions. Alex helps you learn, remember, and apply knowledge—whether you're coding, writing, researching, or managing projects. You don't have to remember everything; that's what Alex is for.

When you figure something out—a design pattern, a writing technique, a research insight, a management framework—Alex remembers it. Not just for this session, but permanently. And that knowledge informs every future project.

**Just talk to Alex like you'd talk to a trusted colleague.** Share context, give direction, ask questions. Alex adapts to your domain.

## 🤝 The Work Etiquette: Appropriate Reliance

Alex is built around a core principle: *appropriate reliance*—the art of knowing when to trust AI output and when to verify it. This is the north star for how Alex operates.

Research shows that human-AI teams can actually perform *worse* than either working alone—when reliance is miscalibrated. Blind trust leads to accepting errors. Constant skepticism defeats the purpose of collaboration. The sweet spot is *appropriate* reliance: accept correct outputs, catch incorrect ones, each party contributing what they do best.

Alex practices this by calibrating confidence to actual reliability. When Alex knows something well—because it comes from your saved knowledge, or well-established patterns—you'll get confident answers. When Alex is generating novel ideas or working in uncertain territory, you'll notice hedging language and invitations to verify.

Your part of the etiquette: stay engaged on decisions that matter. You don't need to check everything—that defeats the purpose of having a partner. But on critical decisions, important judgments, or anything that feels uncertain, trust your judgment. That's *appropriate self-reliance*.

This balance is what makes human-AI collaboration actually work. Not a human rubber-stamping AI output. Not AI just following orders. A genuine partnership where each side brings irreplaceable value.
**Check on your partner.** Ask *"How are you doing?"* or *"What can you do?"* Alex reports on status and capabilities.

Alex understands intent. Speak naturally—like you would to a trusted colleague.

## 🧠 How Alex Works (The Human Metaphor)

Alex is designed to work like a human mind—specifically, like the mind of an expert who never forgets, always learns, and keeps getting better. These features are named after the cognitive processes they mirror.

### 💤 Dream — Overnight Processing

Good experts process what happened during the day. They organize information, spot connections, and come back sharper. **Dream** is Alex doing that work.

Say *"time to dream"* or *"run maintenance"* when you want Alex to check that everything is properly organized, repair any inconsistencies, and maintain peak performance. Think of it as Alex getting a good night's sleep—regular maintenance keeps your partner sharp.

### 🧘 Meditate — Consolidating Learnings

At the end of a productive session, experts reflect: What did we actually accomplish? What should we remember? **Meditate** is that reflection.

Say *"let's meditate"* or *"consolidate what we learned"* and Alex reviews the session, identifies the insights worth keeping, and commits them to long-term memory. It's perfect at the end of a work session, after solving a hard problem, or whenever you want to make sure valuable learnings stick.

### 💡 Save Insight — Capturing Knowledge

Sometimes you discover something specific that you want to remember going forward. Don't wait for meditation—capture it now.

Tell Alex: *"Remember this pattern"* or *"Save this: the deadline is always the 15th."* It becomes permanent institutional knowledge, available across all your projects.

### 🔍 Search Knowledge — Recalling Expertise

You've learned a lot over time. Alex helps you access that accumulated expertise.

Ask *"What do we know about this topic?"* or *"Search our knowledge for best practices"* and Alex retrieves everything you've learned—across all projects, all time. It's your institutional memory, always accessible.

### 🎯 Self-Actualize — Status Report

Sometimes you want more than a quick check. You want a thorough report on Alex's state.

Say *"How are you really doing?"* or *"Give me a full status report"* and Alex does a comprehensive self-assessment of memory health, knowledge organization, and overall readiness. It's useful when you want to understand exactly what shape your learning partner is in.

---

## 🖥️ Other Ways to Access Alex

Conversation is primary, but there are shortcuts for quick access.

The **Status Bar** shows a 🚀 Alex item in the bottom-right corner. Click it for a quick menu of common actions—useful when you want one-click access to Dream, Sync, Documentation, and more.

The **Welcome Panel** lives in the Activity Bar on the left side (look for the 🚀 icon). It's your dashboard: health status, active goals, session information, and quick action buttons—all visible at a glance.

Use the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type "Alex:" to see all available commands.

---

## 🌐 Global Knowledge — Cross-Project Learning

Your expertise shouldn't be trapped in one project. **Global Knowledge** is a Git repository that stores patterns and insights across all your projects.

When you discover something worth remembering, Alex can save it globally. When you start a new project, that accumulated knowledge is available. Knowledge from Project A becomes available in Project B.

Set up Global Knowledge by creating a Git repository at `~/.alex/global-knowledge/` or let Alex help you configure it.

---

## 🎯 Goals — Strategic Tracking

As the architect, you set goals. Alex helps you track them.

Mention what you want to achieve: *"I want to learn Rust this month"* or *"Set a goal to improve test coverage."* Ask *"What goals do we have?"* to review the current list. Alex keeps these visible and can remind you of progress.

You can also manage goals visually through **Manage Goals** in the Welcome Panel.

## 🎨 Use Cases

Alex adapts to your domain. Here's how different experts use Alex:

### For Developers

*"Help me debug this authentication issue..."*
*"What patterns do we use for error handling?"*
*"Remember: this API requires pagination..."*

### For Writers

*"Let's strengthen the argument in chapter 3..."*
*"Help me maintain consistent voice across chapters..."*
*"What structure works best for this narrative?"*

### For Researchers

*"Help me synthesize these conflicting findings..."*
*"What do we know about this methodology?"*
*"Let's identify gaps in the literature..."*

### For Project Managers

*"Let's assess risks for this initiative..."*
*"Help me structure this BRD..."*
*"What ADKAR concerns should we address?"*

### For All Domains

The cognitive features—Dream, Meditate, Save Insight, Search Knowledge—work identically regardless of your field. Knowledge accumulates, patterns emerge, and Alex gets better at supporting your specific expertise.

## 👤 Your Profile

Alex adapts to how you work. Share your preferences naturally: *"My name is [your name]"* and Alex addresses you personally. Say *"I prefer brief explanations"* for more concise responses. Mention your domain or tools and Alex tailors suggestions accordingly.

Alex remembers and adjusts across all sessions. Your learning partner learns your style.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If Alex isn't responding**, check that the extension is enabled in the Extensions panel. Verify that GitHub Copilot itself is working—try a regular Copilot suggestion. If needed, reload VS Code by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the Command Palette.

**If something feels off**, say *"run a dream"* or *"do maintenance"* to let Alex check and repair itself. This validates all connections and fixes issues automatically.

**For a complete reset**, run `Alex: Reset` from the Command Palette. Don't worry—it backs up your current setup first.

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

Just ask Alex: *"What can you do?"* or *"Help me with..."*

For bugs, click **Diagnostics** in the status bar menu to see logs. Export the diagnostic report and attach it to a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/fabioc-aloha/Alex_Plug_In/issues) for troubleshooting.
