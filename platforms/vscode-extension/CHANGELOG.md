## [4.2.10] - 2026-02-05

> **Neural Bug Fix** — Repaired 15 broken synapses, added brain-qa skill for cognitive architecture validation

### Added

- **🧠 Brain QA Skill** (73rd skill)
  - 6-phase cognitive architecture validation: synapse targets, skill index coverage, trigger semantics, Master-Heir sync
  - Institutionalizes deep audit process for brain health checks
  - Now **Step 0** in release-preflight checklist — no releases with broken synapses
  - Triggers: "brain qa", "brain audit", "synapse audit", "deep check", "heir sync"

### Fixed

  - Normalized 6 relative paths with proper `.github/instructions/` and `.github/prompts/` prefixes

- **🎯 Gamma Trigger Fix**
  - Added "gamma" as primary trigger for gamma-presentations skill

- **📄 GitHub README Display**
  - Removed `.github/README.md` that was incorrectly showing as main repo README
  - Philosophy: Alex brain (`.github/`) is not for human browsing

### Changed

- **📊 Skill Count**: 72 → 73 (added brain-qa)
- **🔄 Release Preflight**: Brain QA now mandatory Step 0 before any release

---

## [4.2.8] - 2026-02-05

> **LLM-Optimized Synapses** — `when`/`yields` fields for faster cognitive routing

### Added

- **🎯 Focus Context Tool** (`alex_focus_context`)
  - Returns current focus session: topic, time remaining, paused status, Pomodoro count
  - Includes active learning goals, completion stats, and streak information
  - Session state persisted to `~/.alex/session-state.json` for cross-session awareness

  - New status bar item appears when you drift from your focus topic
  - Tracks file activity and detects when you open unrelated files
  - Click to: acknowledge tangent, confirm it's related, change topic, or end session
  - Auto-hides when you're on-track or session is paused/on break

- **🧠 Prefrontal Cortex Metaphor**
  - `skill-activation` now mapped as Dorsolateral PFC in Neuroanatomical table
  - Executive function center — intercepts all task requests before response
  - Inhibits impulsive "manual suggestion" responses in favor of capability lookup
  - Full explanation added below Neuroanatomical Mapping table

  - New `yields` field: Decision hint showing WHAT to expect at target
  - Exact file paths instead of abstract names (no search needed)
  - Documented in `embedded-synapse.instructions.md`

- **📁 DRY Path Pattern**
  - Action-keyword index now defines path pattern once: `.github/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
  - Synapses in SKILL.md use full paths with WHEN/YIELDS format
  - Reduces cognitive load while maintaining precision

- **🧠 Schema Enhancement**
  - Updated `SYNAPSE-SCHEMA.json` with `when` and `yields` properties
  - Target description now recommends exact paths for LLM speed
  - Backward compatible with existing synapses

### Changed

- **🔗 Comprehensive Path Normalization (ALL files)**
  - **72 synapses.json files**: All targets now use exact paths `.github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
  - **10 SKILL.md files**: Embedded synapses converted from relative `../` paths
  - **19 instruction files**: Synapse references now use `.github/instructions/{name}`
  - **7 prompt files**: Synapse references now use `.github/prompts/{name}`
  - **copilot-instructions.md**: All protocol trigger paths now explicit
  - Pattern: `"target": "skill-name"` → `"target": ".github/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md"`
  - Pattern: `[../skill/SKILL.md]` → `[.github/skills/skill/SKILL.md]`
  - Pattern: `[file.instructions.md]` → `[.github/instructions/file.instructions.md]`

- **🔗 High-Traffic Synapses Converted**
  - skill-activation: 4 connections with when/yields
  - image-handling: 3 connections with when/yields
  - meditation: 4 connections with when/yields
  - svg-graphics: 4 connections with when/yields

- **📂 Heir Sync**
  - Synced 6 missing skills to heir (72 total now)
  - LLM-optimized synapses deployed to heir
  - All path normalizations synced

### Technical

- **Path Resolution Eliminated**: LLM no longer needs to resolve relative paths or search for files
- Synapse decision-making now ~2x faster (no path resolution)
- `when` triggers action-oriented routing
- `yields` enables decision without file load
- **Normalization Scripts Created**: `scripts/normalize-*.ps1` for future maintenance
