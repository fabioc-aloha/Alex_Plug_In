# Publication Strategy for First-Time Authors

A strategic guide for maximizing publication success with the Alex Cognitive Architecture research.

---

## Current Position Assessment

| Factor | Status | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Publication history | None (first-time author) | Challenge |
| Working implementation | ✅ 18 months deployed | Major advantage |
| Open source code | ✅ Apache 2.0, public repo | Advantage |
| User study data | ❌ Not yet conducted | Gap to address |
| Academic collaborator | 🎯 Doctoral supervisor (AI focus) | **Primary opportunity** |
| Pre-print presence | ❌ Not yet posted | Quick win available |

---

## Strategy 0: Collaborate with Doctoral Supervisor (PRIORITY)

### Why This Is Your Best First Move

Your doctoral supervisor is the **highest-probability collaboration path**:

| Advantage | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Existing relationship** | No cold outreach; she already knows your work quality |
| **Invested in your success** | Your publications reflect well on her and the program |
| **AI expertise alignment** | Direct match with Alex's core contribution |
| **Ongoing access** | Regular meetings, not one-off interactions |
| **Network multiplier** | Can introduce you to her collaborators and venue editors |
| **Resource access** | Potential student help for user studies |

### Best Article Versions for AI-Focused Supervisor

Given her AI focus, prioritize these versions:

| Priority | Version | Venue | Why |
|----------|---------|-------|-----|
| **1st** | #10 Agents | NeurIPS Workshop | Core AI/LLM agents topic |
| **2nd** | #04 CogSci | Cognitive Systems Research | AI + cognitive architecture |
| **3rd** | #01 HCI | CHI | Human-AI interaction |
| **4th** | #09 Ethics | FAccT | AI ethics angle |

### Conversation Approach

Since you have an existing relationship, this is a conversation, not a pitch:

```
"I've been working on a side project called Alex—a VS Code extension that
gives AI coding assistants persistent memory. It's been running for 18
months and I think there's a publishable contribution here.

I'd love your advice on:
1. Which AI venues would be strongest for this work
2. Whether you'd be interested in collaborating on a publication

I have draft papers ready targeting NeurIPS workshops, Cognitive Systems
Research, and CHI. Would you have time to look at one and give me your
thoughts?"
```

### Questions to Discuss with Her

1. **"Does this fit with your current research agenda?"** - If yes, stronger motivation
2. **"What AI venues would you target?"** - She knows acceptance patterns
3. **"Would you want to be a co-author, or would acknowledgment be appropriate?"** - Let her choose
4. **"Do you have students who might help with a user study?"** - Multiplies resources
5. **"Is there an angle that connects to your ongoing work?"** - Creates mutual benefit

### What to Prepare Before the Conversation

- [ ] Have arXiv pre-print ready (shows seriousness)
- [ ] Prepare 1-page summary of contributions
- [ ] Know which venues match her publication history
- [ ] Have specific ask ready (co-author vs. advisor vs. introducer)

### Potential Contribution Levels

| Her Contribution | Author Position | Likely Scenario |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Strategic framing + venue selection + edits | 2nd author | Most likely |
| Light feedback + introduction to editors | Acknowledgment | Also valuable |
| Substantial rewriting + theoretical grounding | 2nd author | Best case |
| Connects you with her PhD students for user study | Co-author or Acknowledgment | Bonus |

### Timeline

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **This week** | Post #10 to arXiv (shows you're serious) |
| **Next meeting** | Have the conversation with her |
| **Within 2 weeks** | Clarify collaboration terms if interested |
| **Within 30 days** | Submit first joint paper |

### If She Declines Co-Authorship

Still valuable outcomes:
- Ask for **feedback** on the draft
- Ask for **venue recommendations**
- Ask for **introductions** to researchers in her network
- Ask if her **students** might be interested in collaborating

---

## Strategy 1: Start with Lower-Barrier Venues

### Rationale

Building a publication record makes subsequent submissions stronger. Start where acceptance is likely, then leverage that credibility for higher-tier venues.

### Recommended Progression

```
Trade Publications → Workshop Papers → Journal Articles → Premier Conferences
    (Week 1-2)         (Month 2-3)       (Month 4-6)        (Month 6-12)
```

### Tier 1: Trade Publications (No Peer Review)

| Venue | Article Version | Submission Process | Timeline |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| The New Stack | #11 DevTools | Pitch via editor contact form | 1-2 weeks |
| InfoQ | #02 Adoption | Submit article proposal | 2-3 weeks |
| dev.to | #11 DevTools | Self-publish immediately | Same day |
| Visual Studio Magazine | #11 DevTools | Pitch to editor | 2-4 weeks |
| Hacker News | #03 Future of Work | Post link + discussion | Same day |

**Action**: Publish #11 (DevTools) on dev.to this week, pitch to The New Stack simultaneously.

### Tier 2: Practitioner Journals (Light Review)

| Venue | Article Version | Acceptance Rate | Review Time |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| IEEE Software | #08 Architecture | ~30% | 2-4 months |
| ACM Queue | #04 CogSci | ~40% | 1-2 months |
| Communications of the ACM | #03 Future of Work | ~15% | 3-6 months |

**Action**: Submit #08 to IEEE Software within 30 days.

### Tier 3: Workshops (Lower Bar Than Main Conferences)

| Workshop | Conference | Article Version | Deadline |
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| LLM Agents Workshop | NeurIPS 2026 | #10 Agents | ~September 2026 |
| Human-AI Interaction | CHI 2027 | #01 HCI | ~September 2026 |
| AI-Assisted Development | ICSE 2027 | #08 Architecture | ~October 2026 |

**Action**: Target NeurIPS 2026 LLM Agents Workshop with version #10.

### Cold Email Template

```
Subject: Collaboration opportunity - Building on your [Paper Name] work

Dear Dr. [Name],

I'm Fabio Correa, an independent researcher who has built Alex, a VS Code
extension implementing persistent memory for AI coding assistants. Your work
on [specific paper] directly influenced my architecture design, particularly
[specific element you used].

Alex has been in production use for 18 months with results including:
- 47 persistent memory files accumulated
- 156 synaptic connections mapped
- 89 cross-project knowledge transfers

I'm preparing publications targeting [specific venue] and believe your
expertise in [their area] would strengthen the theoretical framing
significantly. I wonder if you'd be interested in collaborating?

The code is open source: https://github.com/fabioc-aloha/Alex_Plug_In
I've drafted a paper: [arXiv link or Google Doc link]

I'd welcome a 20-minute call to discuss if there's mutual interest. I'm
flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,
Fabio Correa
CorreaX Research

---

## Strategy 4: Conduct User Study

### Why User Studies Matter

Academic venues (especially CHI, CSCW) strongly prefer empirical validation. Even a small study dramatically strengthens submissions.

### Minimum Viable Study Design

**Participants**: 10-15 professional developers

**Duration**: 2-4 weeks of Alex usage

**Data Collection**:

- Pre-survey: Current AI assistant usage, pain points
- Usage logs: Memory accumulation, command usage
- Post-survey: Perceived value, trust, knowledge retention
- Interviews: 3-5 participants, 30-minute semi-structured

**Metrics to Report**:

| Metric | Measurement |
|--------|-------------|
| Context re-establishment time | Self-reported reduction |
| Memory inspection frequency | Log analysis |
| Trust development | Likert scale over time |
| Knowledge persistence value | Qualitative themes |
| Net Promoter Score | Standard NPS question |

### Recruitment Channels

| Channel | Approach | Expected Response |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| VS Code Marketplace | In-extension opt-in | Low volume, high quality |
| Twitter/X | Post seeking beta testers | Medium volume |
| Reddit r/vscode | Community post | Medium volume |
| Dev.to | Article with study recruitment | Low-medium volume |
| Personal network | Direct outreach | High conversion |
| University CS departments | Student participants | High volume, variable quality |

### User Study Timeline

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Prepare consent forms, surveys, interview guide |
| 2 | Recruit participants (target 20 for 15 completions) |
| 3-6 | Participant usage period |
| 7 | Post-survey and interviews |
| 8 | Data analysis |
| 9-10 | Write up findings |

**Action**: Begin recruitment within 60 days if targeting CHI 2027 (September deadline).
