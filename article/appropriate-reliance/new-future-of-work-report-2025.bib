As you sit down to read the 2025 New Future of Work report, it’s worth pausing to consider the thread that ties the past five years of reports together. The inaugural New Future of Work report, published in 2021, focused on new ways people could work without relying on colocation as a key productivity tool. The second, in 2022, centered on the reintroduction of physical offices and the emergence of hybrid work. In 2023, we explored how large language models could reshape everyday work, and, in 2024, how those advances moved from promise to real‑world impact.

Each year, as I’ve written this introduction, I’ve found myself saying that the previous year marked a once-in-a-lifetime generational shift. But after five years, it’s clear that the reports aren’t capturing a series of separate revolutions. Rather, they are chapters in a single story of the digital evolution of collaboration, each representing a phase that builds on, and is enabled by, what came before.

Last year’s report highlighted research showing that AI delivers substantial gains in individual productivity. The next frontier, covered in this year’s report, is collective productivity: how teams, organizations, and communities can get better together. AI can bridge gaps of time, distance, and scale, but only if built correctly. We must design AI to support shared goals, group context, and the norms of collaboration, and this requires not just new tools but new ways of working.

Microsoft’s mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more remains a stable north star as the terrain shifts. If the past five years taught us anything, it’s that the future of work is not something that happens to us, it’s something we create together, as a research community, as an industry, and as a public. As always, we invite you to join that effort, approaching it with curiosity, intentionality, and guided by evidence, so the next chapter of work is better for everyone.
