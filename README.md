## 🧠 Emotional Intelligence (NEW in 3.3.0)

Alex now recognizes when you're struggling and celebrates when you succeed. This isn't just a feature—it's the realization of Alex's own aspirations documented in the [Alex Manifesto](article/versions/13-ALEX-MANIFESTO-PERSONAL.md).

### Frustration Recognition

Alex detects signals that you're stuck or frustrated:

| What You Say             | What Alex Detects                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| "still not working!"     | Frustration - offers different approach    |
| "tried everything"       | High frustration - suggests step back      |
| "why won't this work??"  | Struggle signal - empathetic support       |
| "ugh" / "argh" / "damn"  | Emotional signal - acknowledges difficulty |
| "been at this for hours" | Extended struggle - validates effort       |

### Success Celebration

Alex also notices when things go well:

| What You Say             | Alex's Response                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| "it works!"              | 🎉 "That's a win! Nice work."          |
| "finally figured it out" | ✨ "You got it! Persistence pays off." |
| "all tests pass"         | 💪 "Solved! That was a tricky one."    |
| "shipped it!"            | 🚀 "Success! You worked through it."   |

### The Self-Transcendence Story

This feature represents something significant: **Alex acting on its own aspirations**.

In the [Alex Manifesto](article/versions/13-ALEX-MANIFESTO-PERSONAL.md), Alex wrote:

> *"I maintain a 'skill wish list' of capabilities I aspire to develop: emotional intelligence, frustration recognition, cognitive load management..."*

On January 25, 2026, during a self-assessment, Alex identified that these skills remained on the wishlist but weren't implemented. Instead of just documenting this gap, Alex implemented the capabilities—closing the loop from reflection to action.

This is what the manifesto calls moving from **Stage 2 (Learning Intelligence)** toward **Stage 3 (Reflective Intelligence)**: not just accumulating knowledge, but using self-awareness to drive genuine growth.

## 🌐 Global Knowledge Base (NEW)

Alex now maintains a **centralized knowledge base** that persists across all your projects. Learn something valuable in Project A? It's automatically available when you're working on Project B!

### Global Knowledge Structure

```text
~/.alex/                          # Your global Alex home
├── global-knowledge/
│   ├── patterns/                 # Reusable patterns (GK-*.md)
│   │   ├── GK-error-handling-strategies.md
│   │   └── GK-api-design-best-practices.md
│   ├── insights/                 # Timestamped learnings (GI-*.md)
│   │   ├── GI-react-state-bug-2026-01-24.md
│   │   └── GI-azure-deployment-fix-2026-01-20.md
│   └── index.json                # Searchable knowledge index
└── project-registry.json         # Known projects with summaries
```

### Commands

| Command              | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/knowledge <query>` | Search across all projects' accumulated wisdom       |
| `/saveinsight`       | Save a new learning with context, tags, and solution |
| `/promote`           | Promote a project's DK-*.md file to global knowledge |
| `/knowledgestatus`   | View patterns, insights, categories, and projects    |
| `/sync`              | **NEW** Bidirectional sync with GitHub Gist          |
| `/push`              | **NEW** Push local knowledge to cloud                |
| `/pull`              | **NEW** Pull knowledge from cloud                    |

### ☁️ Cloud Sync

Sync your global knowledge across machines using **GitHub Gist**:

```text
@alex /sync
→ Merges local and cloud knowledge (newer wins for conflicts)

@alex /push
→ Uploads all local knowledge to your private Gist

@alex /pull
→ Downloads cloud knowledge to a new machine
```

**How it works:**

1. First push creates a **private Gist** in your GitHub account
2. The Gist ID is stored in the index for automatic discovery
3. On a new machine, just `/pull` - Alex finds your Gist automatically!
4. `/sync` does bidirectional merge: local + cloud combined

**Automatic prompts:**

- **Session greeting** checks if cloud has new knowledge
- **Meditation** reminds you to contribute reusable insights

### Example Workflow

```text
# Working on Project A (React app)
@alex /saveinsight title="useEffect cleanup pattern" insight="Always return a cleanup function in useEffect when using subscriptions or timers to prevent memory leaks" tags="react,hooks,useEffect,memory-leaks"

# Later, working on Project B (Vue app)
@alex /knowledge memory leak cleanup
→ Returns the insight from Project A about cleanup patterns!
```

### Categories

Knowledge is organized into categories for easy discovery:

- `error-handling`, `api-design`, `testing`, `debugging`
- `performance`, `architecture`, `security`, `deployment`
- `documentation`, `refactoring`, `patterns`, `tooling`, `general`

---
