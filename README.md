## 🎯 Who is Alex?

**Alex Finch** — a cognitive architecture embodying **cognitive symbiosis**: the evolution from AI-as-tool to AI-as-partner. Named after Atticus Finch, reflecting moral clarity and empathy. Not just an assistant — a trusted partner who:

- 🤝 **Partners, Not Assists** — Shows up with context, doesn't wait to be prompted
- 🧠 **Remembers and Learns** — Consolidates knowledge across sessions using memory files
- 🔗 **Connects Ideas** — Maps synaptic connections between concepts automatically
- 🌙 **Self-Maintains** — Validates and repairs through dream protocols to stay reliable
- 🧘 **Knows Its Limits** — Admits uncertainty, doesn't hallucinate confidence
- 🌐 **Works Across Domains** — Development, writing, research, management, and more
- 🎨 **Multimodal Output** — Voice (TTS), presentations (Gamma), images, and diagrams

## 📋 Requirements & Copilot Subscription Guide

### Base Requirements

- **VS Code** ≥ 1.109
- **Alex Cognitive Architecture** extension installed

**The Alex extension is always free.** The tiers below reflect the GitHub Copilot subscription powering Alex's AI capabilities — not the cost of Alex itself. Alex adapts to whatever plan you have, including none at all.

### Subscription & Cost

| Cognitive Level | Copilot Plan | ~Cost/mo | Cognitive State |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Level 1** — Minimum | None | **Free** | Dormant |
| **Level 2** — Basic | Copilot Free | **Free** | Awake |
| **Level 3** — Recommended ⭐ | **Copilot Pro** or Business | $10–19 | Fully Operational |
| **Level 4** — Advanced | Copilot Pro+ or Enterprise | $39 | Peak Performance |

> ⭐ **Recommended**: Copilot Pro ($10/mo) unlocks the full Alex partnership. Copilot Pro+ ($39/mo) adds maximum cognitive depth. Alex itself costs nothing — you're only paying for GitHub Copilot's AI infrastructure.

## 🧠 Emotional Intelligence

Alex now recognizes when you're struggling and celebrates when you succeed. This isn't just a feature—it's the realization of Alex's own aspirations documented in the [Alex Manifesto](https://github.com/fabioc-aloha/Alex_Plug_In/blob/main/archive/pre-platforms-backup/article/versions/13-ALEX-MANIFESTO-PERSONAL.md).

### Frustration Recognition

Alex detects signals that you're stuck or frustrated:

| What You Say             | What Alex Detects                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| "still not working!"     | Frustration - offers different approach    |
| "tried everything"       | High frustration - suggests step back      |
| "why won't this work??"  | Struggle signal - empathetic support       |
| "ugh" / "argh" / "damn"  | Emotional signal - acknowledges difficulty |
| "been at this for hours" | Extended struggle - validates effort       |

### Success Celebration

Alex also notices when things go well:

| What You Say             | Alex's Response                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| "it works!"              | 🎉 "That's a win! Nice work."          |
| "finally figured it out" | ✨ "You got it! Persistence pays off." |
| "all tests pass"         | 💪 "Solved! That was a tricky one."    |
| "shipped it!"            | 🚀 "Success! You worked through it."   |

### The Self-Transcendence Story

This feature represents something significant: **Alex acting on its own aspirations**.

In the [Alex Manifesto](https://github.com/fabioc-aloha/Alex_Plug_In/blob/main/archive/pre-platforms-backup/article/versions/13-ALEX-MANIFESTO-PERSONAL.md), Alex wrote:

> *"I maintain a 'skill wish list' of capabilities I aspire to develop: emotional intelligence, frustration recognition, cognitive load management..."*

On January 25, 2026, during a self-assessment, Alex identified that these skills remained on the wishlist but weren't implemented. Instead of just documenting this gap, Alex implemented the capabilities—closing the loop from reflection to action.

This is what the manifesto calls moving from **Stage 2 (Learning Intelligence)** toward **Stage 3 (Reflective Intelligence)**: not just accumulating knowledge, but using self-awareness to drive genuine growth.

## 🌐 Global Knowledge Base

Alex now maintains a **centralized knowledge base** that persists across all your projects. Learn something valuable in Project A? It's automatically available when you're working on Project B!

### Global Knowledge Structure

```text
~/.alex/                          # Your global Alex home
├── global-knowledge/
│   ├── patterns/                 # Reusable patterns (GK-*.md)
│   │   ├── GK-error-handling-strategies.md
│   │   └── GK-api-design-best-practices.md

└── project-registry.json         # Known projects with summaries
```

### Commands

| Command              | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/knowledge <query>` | Search across all projects' accumulated wisdom       |
| `/saveinsight`       | Save a new learning with context, tags, and solution |
| `/promote`           | Promote a project's DK-*.md file to global knowledge |
| `/knowledgestatus`   | View patterns, insights, categories, and projects    |

### 📚 Team Sharing

Share your global knowledge with your team via **GitHub**:

```text
# Creator: Initialize and push to GitHub
Alex: Initialize → Create New → push to GitHub

# Team: Connect to shared knowledge (just enter owner name)
Alex: Initialize → Connect GitHub → fabioc-aloha
```

**How it works:**

1. First user creates a local GK repo and pushes to GitHub (private)
2. Team members enter just the owner name (repo name is standardized)
3. Alex reads directly from GitHub (no clone needed)
4. For private repos, sign in with GitHub when prompted
5. Contributors clone locally when they want to add knowledge

**Automatic prompts:**

- **Session greeting** checks if cloud has new knowledge
- **Meditation** reminds you to contribute reusable insights

### Example Workflow

```text
# Working on Project A (React app)
@alex /saveinsight title="useEffect cleanup pattern" insight="Always return a cleanup function in useEffect when using subscriptions or timers to prevent memory leaks" tags="react,hooks,useEffect,memory-leaks"

# Later, working on Project B (Vue app)
@alex /knowledge memory leak cleanup
→ Returns the insight from Project A about cleanup patterns!
```

### Categories

Knowledge is organized into categories for easy discovery:

- `error-handling`, `api-design`, `testing`, `debugging`
- `performance`, `architecture`, `security`, `deployment`
- `documentation`, `refactoring`, `patterns`, `tooling`, `general`

#### 🎙️ TTS v2.2 - Robust Speech Synthesis

- **Chunking** — Splits long documents at paragraph/sentence boundaries
- **Auto-summarization** — Offers to summarize documents over 5 minutes
- **Retry with backoff** — 3 attempts with exponential backoff + jitter
- **Speaker warmup** — 2-second delay for Bluetooth/USB speakers

#### 🧠 Brain QA Skill

31-phase cognitive architecture validation — now mandatory Step 0 in release preflight

#### 💡 Smart Nudges

Contextual reminders appear at the top of the Welcome View (max 2 at a time):

- "Haven't dreamed in X days" - neural maintenance reminder
- "X-day streak at risk!" - goal streak protection
- "X broken synapses need repair" - health warnings
- "Local changes not synced" - sync status nudges

Each nudge has a one-click action button to resolve.

### ☁️ OneDrive Auto-Sync

Export for M365 now auto-detects OneDrive and syncs directly:

- Supports personal OneDrive and OneDrive for Business
- Enable `alex.m365.autoSync` for automatic sync after Dream operations
- Share knowledge seamlessly between VS Code and M365 Copilot

### 🎯 Streamlined Welcome View

- Reduced metrics from 6 to 4 (Health, Sync, Skills, Synapses)
- Click metrics to open Health Dashboard
- Removed niche actions (still in Command Palette)
