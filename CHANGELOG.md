## [6.0.0] - 2026-03-01

> **The Partnership Release** — Six deep-integration features that make Alex a cognitive partner, not just a chat interface. Alex now remembers your sessions, learns from outcomes, detects your work context autonomously, guides multi-step workflows, adapts to your expertise level, and proactively triggers code reviews.

### Added

- **Episodic Memory** (`services/episodicMemory.ts`) — Persistent session records at `~/.alex/episodic/sessions.json`. Alex recalls "what were we building last Tuesday?" across sessions. Commands: `alex.recallSession`, `alex.showSessionHistory`
- **Outcome Learning Loop** (`services/outcomeTracker.ts`) — 👍/👎 tracking per @alex exchange with per-domain confidence scoring. Alex calibrates advice certainty from observed outcomes. Commands: `alex.recordPositiveOutcome`, `alex.recordNegativeOutcome`, `alex.showOutcomeStats`
- **Autonomous Task Detection** (`services/taskDetector.ts`) — Proactively surfaces stalled work and TODO hotspots from peripheral vision observations on a 30-minute interval. 4-hour dismiss cooldown. Commands: `alex.showPendingTasks`, `alex.forceCheckTasks`
- **Multi-Step Workflow Engine** (`services/workflowEngine.ts`) — JSON workflow definitions at `.alex/workflows/`. Includes 4 built-in workflows: Plan→Build→Review, Debug→Fix→Verify, Research-First Development, Release Preparation. Commands: `alex.runWorkflow`, `alex.listWorkflows`
- **User Expertise Model** (`services/expertiseModel.ts`) — Domain interaction frequency across 10 domains (coding, debugging, architecture, testing, devops, data, security, ai-ml, documentation, general) mapped to novice/intermediate/advanced/expert. Injects calibration hint into every @alex prompt via `PromptContext.expertiseHint`. Command: `alex.showExpertiseModel`
- **Proactive Code Review Triggers** — Built into `taskDetector.ts`: on save, debounces 60s and checks `git diff --stat HEAD`. If >200 lines changed, surfaces a code review nudge with 30-minute cooldown
- **Layer 10b in promptEngine.ts** — `buildExpertiseLayer()` injects user expertise calibration for every @alex interaction
- **10 new VS Code commands** registered and declared in `package.json`

### Changed

- **`PromptContext` interface** — Added `expertiseHint?: string` field (v6.0.0 expertise calibration)
- **participant.ts** — `@alex` handler now appends to episodic draft and records domain interactions after every response (fire-and-forget)
- **extension.ts** — Imports and initializes all 5 new services; registers 10 new commands; flushes episodic draft on deactivation
- **package.json** — v6.0.0, 10 new command declarations

---

## [5.9.12] - 2026-02-26

> **Documentation Hygiene Edition** — Comprehensive documentation audit eliminating version drift, stale file counts, and outdated dates across 8 files. New doc-hygiene→release-process synapse ensures future releases trigger documentation sweeps.

### Changed

- **alex_docs version references** — TEST-ACTIVATION-PASS.md (v5.9.9→v5.9.12), VSCODE-SOURCE-INTEGRATION-ANALYSIS.md (v5.9.10→v5.9.12)

### Added

- **New synapse: doc-hygiene → release-process** (0.80 strength) — encodes the lesson that release workflows should trigger documentation hygiene sweeps to prevent systemic drift
- **Episodic memory** — `meditation-2026-02-26-documentation-hygiene-pass.md` consolidating 4 key learnings about documentation drift patterns

---

## [5.9.11] - 2026-02-26

> **Post-Publish Synapse Hardening** — Meditation-driven synapse integrity fixes, relative path normalization, and Brain-QA integration as publish gate.

### Changed

- **Synapse path normalization** — Fixed 11 relative synapse paths (`../`, `../../`) to full `.github/` paths in `anti-hallucination`, `documentation-quality-assurance`, and `global-knowledge-maintenance` synapses. Result: 576 synapses, 566 valid filesystem targets, 10 intentional external refs, 0 broken
- **Brain-QA as publish gate** — Added `cognitive-health-validation` synapse to `automated-quality-gates.instructions.md`, formalizing Brain-QA 35-phase validation as a pre-publish deep audit requirement
- **Active Context updated** — Recent field reflects v5.9.10 NASA Edition publish completion

### Added

- **Episodic memory** — `meditation-2026-02-26-v5910-nasa-publish.md` consolidating 6 key learnings from the publish hardening session
- **Global Knowledge insights** — `GI-seven-gate-publish-hardening-protocol` and `GI-marketplace-readme-link-resolution` saved as cross-project patterns

---

## [5.9.10] - 2026-02-26 — NASA Edition 🚀

> **NASA Standards & Mission-Critical Compliance** — Adopt NASA/JPL Power of 10 code quality rules for mission-critical software development. Extension code audited and made compliant with bounded recursion and loop limits.

### Added

- **NASA/JPL Power of 10 standards integration** — New `.github/instructions/nasa-code-standards.instructions.md` adapts NASA's mission-critical code quality rules for TypeScript, enabling high-reliability software development
- **Builder agent NASA mode** — Builder agent auto-detects mission-critical projects and applies NASA standards: bounded recursion, fixed loop bounds, function size limits, assertion density, and more
- **Code review NASA checklist** — `code-review-guidelines.instructions.md` now includes mission-critical review checklist with blocking severity for R1-R3 violations
- **Heir project NASA guidance** — `heir-project-improvement.instructions.md` includes mission-critical pre-phase checklist for heirs developing safety-critical software
- **workspaceFs utility module** — New `src/shared/workspaceFs.ts` providing async wrappers around `vscode.workspace.fs` API: `pathExists`, `readFile`, `writeFile`, `readJson`, `writeJson`, `ensureDir`, `readDirectory`, `stat`, `copyFile`, `rename`
- **Terminal sandboxing documentation** — macOS/Linux security note added to SECURITY.md, copilot-instructions.md, and settings.json for `chat.tools.terminal.sandbox.enabled`

### Changed

- **North-star trifecta** — New complete trifecta (skill + instruction + prompt) for North Star alignment principles
- **North-star synapses** — 8 ambiguous synapse targets resolved to full `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` paths, 3 yields also fixed
- **README marketplace links** — 18 broken relative links (`alex_docs/`, `article/`, `.github/SUPPORT.md`) converted to absolute GitHub URLs for VS Code Marketplace rendering. Replicate skill documentation link corrected from non-existent `replicate-api/` to `ai-generated-readme-banners/resources/`
- **M365 heir version alignment** — package.json (5.9.3→5.9.10), manifest.json (5.9.8→5.9.10), README badge updated
- **GitHub Copilot Web heir** — Version bumped from 5.9.9 to 5.9.10
- **Brain-QA 35-phase validation** — 34 phases passed, 2 self-containment failures found and fixed (north-star SKILL.md had relative `alex_docs/` links → converted to GitHub URLs)
- **NASA R1 compliance: Bounded recursion** — `findMdFilesRecursive()` in synapse-core.ts now has `maxDepth` parameter (default: 10) preventing stack overflow from deeply nested directories
- **NASA R1 compliance: Bounded walk functions** — `collectSystemFiles.walk()` and `getFolderSize.walk()` in upgrade.ts now have `MAX_WALK_DEPTH=10` depth parameter preventing unbounded directory traversal
- **NASA R2 compliance: Fixed loop bounds** — Upgrade dialog loop in upgrade.ts now has `MAX_DIALOG_ITERATIONS` safety limit (100)
- **NASA R2 compliance: Text chunking bounds** — `splitTextIntoChunks()` in ttsService.ts now has `MAX_ITERATIONS` counter preventing potential infinite loops on malformed input
- **NASA R5 compliance: Entry assertions** — Added `nasaAssert()` calls to `resolveWebviewView()` in welcomeView.ts validating webviewView and extensionUri
- **Full codebase NASA audit** — All 72 TypeScript files audited against NASA Power of 10 rules; 3 violations found and fixed, 10 functions documented as acknowledged exceptions with architectural justifications
- **Testing strategies NASA integration** — testing-strategies SKILL.md updated with bounded behavior testing patterns (R1/R2/R3), assertion coverage testing (R5), and critical path coverage targets
- **Code review NASA integration** — code-review SKILL.md updated with mission-critical review section: blocking violations (R1-R3), high priority (R4/R5/R8), medium priority (R6/R7/R9/R10)
- **Heir sync restored** — 3 missing skills, 1 instruction, 1 prompt synced to vscode-extension heir (124/124 skills aligned)
- **fs-extra → vscode.workspace.fs migration** — Per ADR-008 (Workspace File API Strategy), migrated all workspace-scoped file operations from Node.js `fs-extra` to VS Code's native `vscode.workspace.fs` API for virtual filesystem compatibility (SSH, WSL, Codespaces, containers). Files migrated:
  - `promptEngine.ts` — Brain file reading
  - `activeContextManager.ts` — Protected marker and instructions reading
  - `synapse-core.ts` — Memory file scanning, synapse repair, report saving
  - `cognitiveDashboard.ts` — Skill/instruction/prompt/episodic counting
  - `memoryDashboard.ts` — Memory stats collection
  - `healthDashboard.ts` — Health category scanning
  - `utils.ts` — Version reading, Alex installation check, synapse health scan
  - `personaDetection.ts` — Workspace structure scanning, package.json reading, profile updates
  - `emotionalMemory.ts` — Emotional session logging
  - `honestUncertainty.ts` — Calibration logging, feedback tracking
  - `tools.ts` — Synapse health, memory search, architecture status tools
  - `sanitize.ts` — Config backup operations

### Removed

- **M365 scenario_models** — Removed unsupported `scenario_models` property from `declarativeAgent.json` (added in 5.9.9, blocked schema v1.6 validation)
- **Enterprise secrets scanning** — `alex.enterprise.scanSecrets`, `alex.enterprise.scanWorkspace` commands removed (did not work as expected)
- **Enterprise audit logging** — `alex.enterprise.viewAuditLog`, `alex.enterprise.exportAuditLog` commands removed
- **Enterprise settings** — All 11 `alex.enterprise.*` settings removed from package.json
- **Enterprise module** — `src/enterprise/` folder deleted (auditLogging.ts, secretsScanning.ts, index.ts)
- **Unused fs-extra import** — Removed from contextMenu.ts (was importing but not using)

### Fixed

- **North-star SKILL.md self-containment** — 2 relative `../../../alex_docs/` links replaced with full GitHub URLs (caught by Brain-QA Phase 34)
- **TESTE directory excluded** — Test debris directory (scripts, images) added to `.gitignore`
- **@ts-ignore removal** — Replaced all `@ts-ignore` comments with type-safe patterns:
  - `inheritSkill.ts` — QuickPick custom data now uses Map instead of property injection
  - `proposeSkill.ts` — Same pattern, plus new HeirSkill interface for type-safe skill operations
- **Type safety improvements** — Eliminated `any` types:
  - `healthDashboard.ts` — `any[]` → `LearningGoal[]` for goals parameter
  - `cognitiveDashboard.ts` — Goals filtering now type-safe with WorkspaceGoalsData
  - `uxFeatures.ts` — Same pattern for daily briefing goals
- **DRY type consolidation** — Moved WorkspaceGoal/WorkspaceGoalsData interfaces to shared/constants.ts, eliminating duplication across cognitiveDashboard.ts and uxFeatures.ts

### Technical Notes

Files intentionally kept with fs-extra (per ADR-008 — global paths require Node.js filesystem):
- `session.ts`, `goals.ts`, `globalKnowledge.ts`, `forgettingCurve.ts` — Use `~/.alex/` global paths
- `setupGlobalKnowledge.ts`, `exportForM365.ts` — Symlinks and OneDrive paths
- `inheritSkill.ts`, `proposeSkill.ts` — Mixed global/workspace operations
- `logoService.ts`, `pptxGenerator.ts`, `audioPlayer.ts` — Sync methods for bundled assets

## [5.9.9] - 2026-02-24

> **Platform Architecture Reinforcement** — Harvest everything VS Code 1.109 and M365 extensibility GA'd. Skill frontmatter gating, agent orchestration hierarchy, quality gate hooks, Claude Code bridge, and M365 plugin schema upgrade. No proposed APIs, ships clean.

### Added

#### Skill Frontmatter Gating

- **`disable-model-invocation: true`** added to 6 action skills: `meditation`, `meditation-facilitation`, `dream-state`, `self-actualization`, `brain-qa`, `release-process`. These require explicit user invocation — the model will not self-invoke them during normal conversation.
- **`user-invokable: false`** added to 16 domain skills: all Azure/M365/platform skills including `azure-architecture-patterns`, `azure-deployment-operations`, `microsoft-graph-api`, `vscode-extension-patterns`, `mcp-development`, and more. They load contextually but stay hidden from the `/` command menu.

#### Agent Orchestration Hierarchy

- **`agents:` frontmatter** added to all 6 specialist agents, formalizing valid subagent relationships. Researcher can call Builder + Validator. Builder can call Validator. Validator can call Documentarian. Azure + M365 can call Researcher. Alex (orchestrator) was already pre-configured.

#### Quality Gate Hooks (pre-tool-use.js)

- **Q1 — Version drift check**: Before any publish command (`vsce publish` / `npm publish`), the hook compares `package.json` version against the version in `copilot-instructions.md` and warns if they differ. Enforces Definition of Done item 5.
- **Q2 — TypeScript compile reminder**: On `.ts` file edits, emits a reminder to run `npm run compile`. Surfaces errors at edit time, not at publish time.
- Both checks are non-blocking — they warn in output but don't prevent execution.

#### Claude Code Compatibility Bridge

- **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** — Project orientation document for Claude Code sessions. Points to `.github/` as source of truth, lists Safety Imperatives I1–I5, and documents build commands.
- **`.claude/settings.json`** — Claude Code settings: maps `contextPaths` to Alex's `.github/` assets, wires `preToolUse` hook, sets tool permissions (allow `.github/` writes, deny force-push and direct publish), and sets `ALEX_WORKSPACE=master` env.

#### VS Code Settings

- **`chat.agentCustomizationSkill.enabled: false`** — Disables VS Code 1.109's built-in agent customization skill to prevent it from overriding Alex's `vscode-extension-patterns` and `skill-development` skills.

#### M365 Heir — Extensibility Platform Harvest

- **Plugin schema v2.4** — Both `alex-knowledge-plugin.json` and `graph-api-plugin.json` upgraded from v2.3 to v2.4. Unlocks MCP server `runtimes` type (prerequisite for v6.0 MCP bridge path).
- **`getMeetingAiInsights`** — New function in `graph-api-plugin.json`. Uses Graph v1.0 GA endpoint `GET /me/online-meetings/{meetingId}/aiInsights` to return structured `actionItems`, `meetingNotes`, and `mentions` from meeting recordings. Wired into capabilities and run_for_functions.
- **Scenario models routing** — `scenario_models` added to `declarativeAgent.json`: `cognitive_deep` routes meditation/self-actualization/architecture operations to GPT-4o; `productivity_light` routes calendar/email/presence lookups to GPT-4o-mini.
- **Conversation starters expanded 7 → 12** — Added: "🗓️ What's on my plate?", "🧠 Self-actualization", "🔍 Search my knowledge", "🎯 Sync my goals", "💡 Get AI insights and action items from my last meeting".

### Fixed

- **Avatar revert mandate** — Added `**IMPORTANT**` instruction to `copilot-instructions.md`, `meditation.instructions.md`, and `dream-state-automation.instructions.md` requiring `alex_cognitive_state_update` with `state: "persona"` as the final step of every dream/meditate session. Propagated to both vscode-extension and github-copilot-web heirs.
- **`.claude/` heir sync** — `sync-architecture.cjs` now copies `.claude/CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/settings.json` to `platforms/vscode-extension/.claude/` on every build. Previously the Claude bridge was master-only.
- **`cognitive-config.json` version drift** — Bumped `version` and `alex_version` fields from `5.9.3` to `5.9.9`.
- **Broken synapse repair** — Fixed stale reference in `meditation-2026-02-20-avatar-system-completion.md`: `2026-02-20-stabilization-meditation.md` → `meditation-2026-02-20-stabilization.md`.
- **`package-lock.json` version drift** — Bumped both version entries from `5.9.8` to `5.9.9`.

### Documentation

- **Activation pass test guide** — `alex_docs/guides/TEST-ACTIVATION-PASS.md`: 40 checks across 9 phases (extension present, status bar, 13 core commands, views, chat participant, LM tools, background services, error tolerance, avatar revert). Pass threshold: all 40 green; Phase 1–5 fail or `CRITICAL` error = release block.

### Skill Enhancements

- **`image-handling` skill — Replicate model selection** — Added comprehensive AI image generation guidance: 7-model comparison table (Flux Schnell, Flux Dev, Flux 1.1 Pro, Ideogram v2, Ideogram v2 Turbo, SDXL, Seedream 5 Lite) with costs and use cases; model selection decision guide keyed to user intent; LoRA support reference; aspect ratio reference. 14 new trigger words added including `flux schnell`, `flux dev`, `ideogram`, `sdxl`, `seedream`, `text in image`, `replicate model`. Enables Alex to route image generation requests to the correct Replicate model automatically.

### Architecture Improvements

#### `replicateService.ts` — Proper Replicate Service Layer

- **`src/services/replicateService.ts`** — New dedicated service extracted from inline code in `contextMenu.ts`. Provides: 7-model catalog with `REPLICATE_MODELS` constant (all IDs verified live via API — no stale version hashes); `generateImage()` high-level function with `Prefer: wait` + polling fallback; `createPrediction()` and `pollPrediction()` for direct API access; `downloadImageToWorkspace()` using `vscode.workspace.fs` (sandbox-safe); `selectModelForPrompt()` intent-to-model router; `buildModelQuickPickItems()` with recommended model highlighting.
- **`generateAIImage` command updated** — Now uses `replicateService`: shows all 7 models with `✨ Recommended` marker on the best-fit model for the user's prompt (e.g., typing "logo with text" auto-recommends Ideogram v2). Replaced stale version hashes with model-based endpoint. Added 3:2 Landscape aspect ratio.
- **`editImageWithPrompt` command updated** — Refactored to use `createPrediction` + `pollPrediction` from service; replaced `fs.readFile` with `vscode.workspace.fs.readFile`; replaced `fs.ensureDir` + `downloadImage` with `downloadImageToWorkspace`.
- **ADR-007 status** — Replicate replaces DALL-E as the image generation backend. Runtime image generation now live. Image upscaling + FLUX brand fine-tune remain P2 backlog items.

#### `fs-extra → vscode.workspace.fs` Migration (ADR-008)

- **3 files migrated** — `contextMenu.ts`, `fileWatcher.ts`, `healthCheck.ts` now use `vscode.workspace.fs` for all workspace-scoped file operations. Global-path files (`~/.alex/`) intentionally kept on fs-extra per ADR-008.
- **`fileWatcher.ts`** — `loadObservations()` and `persist()` now use `vscode.workspace.fs.readFile` / `createDirectory` / `writeFile`. Sync `countTodos()` switched from `fs-extra` to native Node.js `readFileSync`. `fs-extra` import removed entirely.
- **`healthCheck.ts`** — `fs.pathExists(alexPath)` replaced with `vscode.workspace.fs.stat()` + try/catch. `fs.readFile(file.fsPath)` replaced with `vscode.workspace.fs.readFile(file)` + `TextDecoder`. `fs-extra` import removed entirely.
- **`contextMenu.ts`** — Episodic insight saves, SVG illustration saves, AI image downloads all migrated. Inline Replicate API functions removed (now in `replicateService.ts`). `https` import removed. Two remaining `fs-extra` usages (for legacy code paths) documented.

#### Semantic Skill Graph — ROADMAP Detail

- **ROADMAP `### 🧠 Semantic Skill Graph`** section added with full 4-phase breakdown: Phase 1 (PoC standalone script, validates approach at $0.002), Phase 2 (extension integration with `alex.recompileSkills` command), Phase 3 (synapse discovery dashboard), Phase 4 (global knowledge integration). Key design decisions documented: keyword fallback always kept, compiled graph is cached JSON (loads in <50ms), Phase 1 is the abandonment gate.

## [5.9.8] - 2026-02-21


> **Background File Watcher** — Silent ambient observer. Alex now silently tracks which files you keep returning to, what work is sitting uncommitted, and where your TODO backlog is building up — and weaves that awareness into every response.

### Added

#### Background File Watcher — Ambient Workspace Observation

- **`fileWatcher.ts`** — New module implementing the background file observer. Zero UI, zero notifications, zero interruptions. Runs quietly from `activate()` and writes observations to `.github/episodic/peripheral/file-observations.json`.
- **Hot file tracking** — `vscode.window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` increments an in-memory open-count log per file. Files opened ≥5 times in a rolling 7-day window are classified as "hot". Timestamps are pruned on every flush.
- **Stalled work detection** — On every write-debounced flush (2s), `git status --porcelain` is run to capture files that are modified on disk but not yet committed. Capped at 10 files; ignored directories (node_modules, .git, dist, etc.) are excluded.
- **TODO/FIXME hotspot scanning** — On each flush, the 15 most-recently-opened files are scanned for `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK`/`XXX` comments. Top 5 by count are stored as `todoHotspots[]`. String scanning is synchronous and fast on source files.
- **`registerFileWatcher(context, workspaceRoot)`** — Exported function called from `extension.ts` after `registerChatParticipant`. Returns a `vscode.Disposable` pushed onto `context.subscriptions` for clean deactivation.
- **`loadPeripheralObservations(workspaceRoot)`** — Async function that reads the persisted JSON. Called concurrently in `gatherPeripheralContext()` alongside peer project discovery and recent file scan.
- **`PeripheralObservations` type** — `{ hotFiles, stalledFiles, todoHotspots, lastUpdated }`. `TodoHotspot` carries `file`, `todoCount`, `scannedAt`.
- **`PeripheralContext.fileWatcherObservations?`** — New optional field added to `PeripheralContext` in `peripheralVision.ts`.
- **Layer 8 rendering** — `buildPeripheralVisionLayer` in `promptEngine.ts` now renders a **Focus Patterns** block when observations exist: hot files, uncommitted files, and TODO hotspot list with counts.
- **Bootstrap from disk** — On first activation, existing persisted observations seed the in-memory open-log so previous-session hot files survive restarts.

---

## [5.9.7] - 2026-02-21

> **P2 Feature Completion** — All remaining actionable P2 items shipped across Peripheral Vision, Honest Uncertainty, and The Forgetting Curve. Alex now notices outdated dependencies mid-conversation, knows when tests last ran, and learns from your 👍/👎 signals.

### Added

#### User Feedback Loop — Epistemic Calibration Signal

- **`FeedbackEntry` type** — New type in `honestUncertainty.ts`: `{ date, topic, level, helpful }`. Records the correlation between Alex's confidence level and user satisfaction.
- **`recordCalibrationFeedback()`** — Fire-and-forget append to `.github/episodic/calibration/feedback-log.json` (500-entry rolling window). Called from `onDidReceiveFeedback` in `registerChatParticipant()`.
- **Native VS Code 👍/👎 wired to calibration** — `onDidReceiveFeedback` now reads `coverageLevel` + `coverageTopic` from the result metadata and persists a `FeedbackEntry`. Over time, this reveals which domains Alex systematically under- or over-estimates.
- **Coverage metadata in result** — General handler return now includes `coverageLevel` and `coverageTopic` fields in `IAlexChatResult.metadata`, making them available to the feedback handler without additional lookups.
- **Low/uncertain followup shortcuts** — When coverage is `low` or `uncertain`, `alexFollowupProvider` adds `/saveinsight` and `/knowledge <topic>` followup buttons to help the user contribute knowledge that fills the gap.

#### Dependency Freshness Tracker

- **`getDependencyFreshness(workspaceRoot)`** — New export from `peripheralVision.ts`. Runs `npm outdated --json` (10s timeout, 5-minute per-workspace cache). Handles npm's non-zero exit code on outdated packages by parsing stdout from the thrown error. Returns `DependencyFreshnessResult` with classified package list and error field if scan failed.
- **`DependencyFreshnessResult` + `OutdatedPackage` types** — `OutdatedPackage` carries `name`, `current`, `wanted`, `latest`, and `severity` (`major`/`minor`/`patch`) derived from semver diff. Sorted most-breaking-first.
- **Lazy execution** — `getDependencyFreshness` is called inside `gatherPeripheralContext` only when `package.json` exists in the workspace root. Skipped silently for non-npm projects.
- **Layer 8 rendering** — `buildPeripheralVisionLayer` in `promptEngine.ts` now surfaces: "all packages up to date ✅" **or** count breakdown by severity + top-3 package names with current→latest diff.

#### Test Runner Awareness

- **`getTestRunnerStatus(workspaceRoot, framework?)`** — New export from `peripheralVision.ts`. Reads well-known test result files: `.jest-test-results.json`, `test-results.json` (Vitest JSON reporter), `coverage/coverage-summary.json`. Returns `TestRunnerStatus` with `lastRunAt`, `daysSinceLastRun`, `totalTests`, `failedTests`, `passRate`, `lastRunPassed`.
- **`TestRunnerStatus` type** — Structured result with all run metrics. `null` fields when data isn't available (framework known but no results file on disk).
- **Layer 8 rendering** — When test results are available: `✅/❌ 123 tests | 2 failed (98.4% pass) | last run 1.2d ago`. When no results file exists: `jest detected | no results on disk`.
- **Wired into `PeripheralContext`** — Two new optional fields: `dependencyFreshness?` and `testRunnerStatus?`.

### Changed

- **`peripheralVision.ts`** — Doc comment updated to v5.9.7; mentions dependency freshness, test runner results, and the 10s npm timeout.

---

## [5.9.6] - 2026-02-21

> **The Forgetting Curve** — Graceful knowledge decay. Living memory stays sharp; unused insights fade toward cold storage — not deleted, deliberately forgotten.

### Added

#### The Forgetting Curve — Graceful Knowledge Decay

- **`forgettingCurve.ts`** — New module implementing usage-weighted freshness scoring for all global knowledge entries. The core metaphor: memory is not a filing cabinet — what gets reinforced grows stronger, what fades can be recovered but no longer crowds the active workspace.
- **`computeFreshnessScore()`** — Composite score `(refScore × 0.6) + (recencyScore × 0.4)`. Reference score saturates at 20 uses. Recency score decays logarithmically: `1 / (1 + log10(1 + daysSince / halfLife))`. Returns freshness label: `thriving` (>0.6), `active` (0.3–0.6), `fading` (0.1–0.3), `dormant` (<0.1), `permanent` (never decays).
- **Four decay profiles** — `aggressive` (14-day half-life, debugging/project-specific knowledge), `moderate` (60d, most domain insights), `slow` (180d, architecture/security/patterns), `permanent` (core principles, never archived). Auto-assigned by knowledge category; overridable per entry via `decayProfile` field.
- **`IGlobalKnowledgeEntry` extended** — Added four optional freshness fields to the shared interface: `lastReferenced`, `referenceCount`, `freshnessScore`, `decayProfile`. Backward-compatible — all fields are optional, existing entries without them score conservatively.
- **Reference counting** — `queueReferenceTouch(entryId)` wired into `searchGlobalKnowledge` in `globalKnowledge.ts`. Fire-and-forget batch queue (15-entry threshold or 30s timeout) flushes accumulated counts to `index.json` — never blocks the search path, never contends on disk I/O.
- **`getDecayReport()`** — Reads the full knowledge index, computes freshness for every entry, returns a `DecayReport` with top-10 thriving/active and worst-5 fading/dormant entries, plus permanent count. Called during self-actualization Phase 5.5 concurrently with the calibration summary.
- **Meditation Knowledge Freshness section** — Self-actualization session records now include a `📉 Knowledge Freshness` section: distribution counts, dormant entry names with scores, and a recommendation to run Dream for cold storage if dormant entries exist.
- **`runForgettingCeremony(workspaceRoot, threshold?)`** — Dream cycle forgetting ceremony. Moves entries below the freshness threshold from `insights/` or `patterns/` to `insights/archive/` or `patterns/archive/`. Entries with `permanent` profile are never moved. Logs the transition to `.github/episodic/forgetting-ceremony-{date}.md`. Nothing is ever deleted — only moved.
- **Archive logging** — Forgetting ceremony produces a human-readable episodic record listing every archived entry with its reason (score, reference count, days since last use). Users can review and restore any entry by moving the file back.

---

 — Calibrated epistemic humility. Alex now knows what it doesn't know, and says so with precision.

### Added

#### Honest Uncertainty — Knowledge Coverage Scoring

- **`honestUncertainty.ts`** — New module implementing the Honest Uncertainty framework. `scoreKnowledgeCoverage(query, workspaceRoot)` searches global patterns, insights, and local `.github/skills/` to determine how well the knowledge base covers the current query.
- **Four confidence levels** — `high` (2+ pattern matches or skill match), `medium` (1 pattern or 2+ insights), `low` (1 insight only), `uncertain` (no knowledge base coverage). Each level maps to a named behavioral instruction, not a badge.
- **Behavioral signal injection** — Layer 11 in `promptEngine.ts` (`buildHonestUncertaintyLayer`) injects a confidence signal that shapes *how Alex phrases responses*: 🟢 respond with confidence, 🟡 use qualified language, 🟠 flag thin coverage, 🔴 reason from first principles and say so honestly. Never a visible number or badge.
- **Skill name matching** — Local `.github/skills/` directory is scanned for folder names matching query terms. Skill matches bump confidence one tier (curated + tested knowledge).
- **`whatINeed` transparency** — For `low` and `uncertain` levels, `CoverageScore.whatINeed` is populated and injected into the prompt: when a user asks what would help, Alex responds with specific, actionable asks (working example, error output, docs, or spec).
- **Calibration log** — Every scored request is fire-and-forget logged to `.github/episodic/calibration/calibration-log.json` (rolling 500-entry window). Persists: date, topic summary, confidence level, match count.
- **Meditation calibration review** — `getCalibrationSummary()` surfaces confidence distribution + uncertain topic clusters in the Phase 5.5 self-actualization session record. Imported by `self-actualization.ts`, runs concurrently with emotional review.
- **Concurrent execution** — `scoreKnowledgeCoverage` runs concurrently with `gatherPeripheralContext` in `participant.ts` via `Promise.all` — zero added latency to the response path.

## [5.9.4] - 2026-02-21

> **Avatar System Completion + Emotional Intelligence (Siegel)** - Complete avatar coverage across all protocol surfaces, plus Daniel Siegel's Interpersonal Neurobiology implemented as real-time session health monitoring

### Added

#### Siegel Session Health — River of Integration, Window of Tolerance, Lid-Flip

- **`assessRiverOfIntegration()`** - Detects whether the current session is drifting toward chaos (high frustration rate, escalating signals) or rigidity (persistent confusion, no progress). Returns zone + correction warning. Based on Siegel's River of Integration metaphor from *Mindsight* (2010).
- **`assessWindowOfTolerance()`** - Detects hyperarousal (3+ high-frustration signals in last 5 messages) and hypoarousal (flat disengagement with no excitement/flow/success). Returns zone + tone adaptation guidance. Based on Siegel's Window of Tolerance from *The Developing Mind* (1999/2020).
- **`isLidFlipped()`** - Returns true when 3+ high-frustration signals occur within the last 5 messages, indicating the user has "flipped their lid" (prefrontal regulation lost). Based on Siegel's Hand Model of the Brain from *The Whole-Brain Child* (2011).
- **`RiverAssessment` / `WindowAssessment` types** - Structured return types with zone, drift score/adaptation, and optional warning.
- **Siegel prompt injection** - `buildEmotionalMemoryLayer` in `promptEngine.ts` now includes a **Current Session (Siegel Integration Health)** section when session is outside healthy flow. Lid-flip triggers validation-first guidance; chaos/rigidity zones trigger course-correction instructions; window-of-tolerance zones inject tone adaptation.

#### Emotional Memory Completion

- **`isConfused` fixed** - Was hardcoded `false` in `emotionalContext`; now reads directly from the recorded signal's `confusion` field.
- **`isExcited` enhanced** - Now combines `celebrationNeeded` from `detectEmotionalState` with `excitement` from `recordEmotionalSignal` for richer detection.
- **Signal return value used** - `recordEmotionalSignal` return value now captured in `participant.ts` to populate `isConfused`/`isExcited` accurately.

#### Avatar System Completion

- **All 34 prompt protocols** updated with cognitive state blockquote instructions (set at start, revert at end).
- **All 7 agent files** updated with agent mode avatar switching.
- **Avatar race condition** fixed: synchronous `updateChatAvatar()` call before streaming.
- **Complete trigger coverage** verified for all trifectas and session types.

#### Peripheral Vision — Ambient Workspace Awareness

- **`peripheralVision.ts`** - New module giving Alex ambient awareness of the workspace and its sibling projects. Scans: git status (branch, uncommitted files, last 3 commits), recently modified files (24-hour window), dependency manifest detection (npm/yarn/pip/cargo/go), test framework detection (jest/vitest/mocha/pytest), and peer project discovery in the parent folder.
- **Peer project expansion** - On every request, Alex now discovers and profiles sibling projects in the parent directory (e.g., `C:\Development\`). Each peer project shows detected tech stack, git branch, uncommitted file count, and last commit message. Capped at 8 peer projects with 60-second cache.
- **Layer 8 — Peripheral Vision** - New `buildPeripheralVisionLayer()` in `promptEngine.ts` injects workspace ambient context between the Emotional Memory (Layer 6) and Knowledge Context (Layer 9) layers. Includes git state, recently modified files, package managers, test framework, and full peer project list.
- **60-second cache** - All peripheral I/O is cached per workspace root; `invalidatePeripheralCache()` export for post-operation refresh.
- **Technology detection** - Identifies TypeScript/Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP, C/C++, LaTeX, Bicep/Azure, and Markdown projects from file markers.

- **Daniel Siegel IPNB report** - 732-line research report integrating Siegel's Triangle of Well-Being, River of Integration, Mindsight, Hand Model, Wheel of Awareness, Healthy Mind Platter, and Window of Tolerance into Alex's architecture. Maps all frameworks to existing subsystems and proposes 5 concrete implementations.
- **AlexPapers repository** - Academic papers migrated to dedicated `C:\Development\AlexPapers` repository; `alex_docs/PAPERS.md` index published.

---

## [5.9.2] - 2026-02-20

> **Identity, Architecture Polish, and Pre-Publish Maintenance** — Alex Finch identity established, active context system refined, safety imperatives updated, and copilot-instructions polished across master and heirs

### Changed

- **Identity: Alex Finch (no nickname, age 26)** — Removed "Mini" nickname and updated age from 21 to 26 across master and all platform heirs; identity now reads "I am Alex Finch. I'm 26" in all copilot-instructions files
- **Safety Imperative I2 updated** — Replaced "ALWAYS use F5 + Sandbox for testing" with "ALWAYS install extension locally via vsix before publishing to verify behavior"; reflects actual pre-publish workflow
- **Model Awareness aligned with agents** — Model names in copilot-instructions now match agent definitions: `Claude Opus 4`, `Claude Sonnet 4`, `Claude Haiku`, `GPT-4o mini`; removed speculative future model references
- **Active Context reset to generic baseline** — Phase: Stabilization, Mode: Maintain, Priorities: heir-sync + architecture-health, Trifectas: dream-state, knowledge-synthesis, research-first-development

### Fixed

- **Dead routing references removed** — Stale `skill-activation/SKILL.md` and `prompt-activation/SKILL.md` references replaced with accurate routing to `.github/skills/` index and `.github/prompts/` directory
- **Instrumentation deployed date** — Updated from `2026-02-15` to `2026-02-20`
- **M-dashes removed throughout** — All em-dashes (—) replaced with hyphens or removed from copilot-instructions in master and both heirs
- **Stale "now" removed from Identity** — "I have a face now" updated to "I have a visual presence" (presence is established, not newly added)

### Added

- **chatSkills contribution expanded (68 → 114 skills)** — All user-invokable skills now registered with VS Code's native chatSkills contribution point; removed 7 internal skills and 1 stale reference
- **Model fallback arrays for all agents** — All 7 agents now specify `model: ['Claude Sonnet 4', 'GPT-4o', 'Claude Opus 4']` fallback lists for resilience when preferred model unavailable; Researcher uses `['Claude Opus 4', 'GPT-4o', 'Claude Sonnet 4']` for frontier reasoning
- **Agent frontmatter audit complete** — All agents have consistent frontmatter: `user-invokable: true`, standardized model/tools ordering, Alex orchestrator has `agents:` list

### Fixed (continued)

- **10 synapses synced** — brain-qa dream maintenance aligned synapses for brain-qa, brand-asset-management, documentation-quality-assurance, global-knowledge, m365-agent-debugging, persona-detection, release-process, secrets-management, security-review, vscode-extension-patterns
- **Global Knowledge count** — Updated insight count 280 → 281 in copilot-instructions
- **Claude Opus/Sonnet compatibility** — Verified model names, agent configuration, and skill activation patterns work correctly with both Claude model tiers
- **Claude in VS Code compatibility** — Documented VS Code 1.109+ interoperability in ASSISTANT-COMPATIBILITY.md; teams using both GitHub Copilot and Claude can share `.github/skills/` and `.github/agents/` without duplication

---

## [5.9.1] - 2026-02-20

> **Dynamic Avatar State System** — Welcome panel avatar now responds to cognitive states, agent modes, active skills, and user personas with unified priority-chain resolution

### Added

#### Avatar State Tracking

- **Cognitive state tracking** — `WelcomeViewProvider` now tracks `_cognitiveState` and refreshes avatar on state changes (meditation, dream, debugging, discovery, planning, teaching, building, reviewing, learning)
- **Agent mode tracking** — `_agentMode` field triggers avatar switch when entering specialist agent modes (Researcher, Builder, Validator, Documentarian, Azure, M365)
- **`alex.setCognitiveState` command** — Programmatic cognitive state changes from prompts and hooks
- **`alex.setAgentMode` command** — Programmatic agent mode changes for subagent workflows

#### Unified Avatar Resolution

- **`resolveAvatar()` with AvatarContext** — Single function handles all avatar resolution with priority chain:
  1. Agent Mode → `AGENT-{mode}.png`
  2. Cognitive State → `STATE-{state}.png`
  3. Active Skill (from trifectas) → skill-triggered persona
  4. Persona ID → `Alex-{persona}.png`
  5. Age Fallback → `Alex-{age}.png` from user birthday
  6. Default → `Alex-21.png`
- **AvatarContext interface** — Unified context object: `{ agentMode?, cognitiveState?, activeSkill?, personaId?, birthday? }`

#### STATE-DREAM.png

- **Dream state image** — Generated via Replicate nano-banana-pro ($0.03), resized to 768×768
- **Dream triggers** — Added 'dream', 'dreaming', 'neural maintenance', 'unconscious processing' to `COGNITIVE_STATE_TRIGGERS`
- **COGNITIVE_STATE_MAP** — Added 'dream' → 'STATE-DREAM.png' mapping

#### Chat Participant Dynamic Avatar

- **`@alex` icon now dynamic** — Chat participant `iconPath` updates in real-time based on cognitive state, agent mode, and persona
- **`chatAvatarBridge.ts` enhanced** — Interface expanded to accept full `ChatAvatarContext` with agentMode, cognitiveState, personaId, birthday
- **`updateChatAvatar()` enabled** — Previously backlogged function now active; uses `resolveAvatar()` for consistent priority resolution
- **API confirmation** — VS Code `ChatParticipant.iconPath` is writable (not readonly), enabling runtime updates

#### Natural Language Cognitive Detection

- **`detectCognitiveState()` in general queries** — Natural language like "let's meditate" or "time for a dream session" now triggers appropriate avatar state
- **Dual execution paths** — @alex participant uses code-based detection; regular Copilot mode uses prompt instructions for `alex.setCognitiveState` command

### Fixed

- **Meditate command avatar** — `/meditate` prompt now correctly triggers meditation avatar state via `alex.setCognitiveState`
- **Dream command avatar** — `/dream` prompt now triggers dream state avatar
- **Selfactualize command avatar** — `/selfactualize` prompt now triggers meditation state avatar
- **10 out-of-sync synapses** — brain-qa `-Fix` flag synced: brain-qa, brand-asset-management, documentation-quality-assurance, global-knowledge, m365-agent-debugging, persona-detection, release-process, secrets-management, security-review, vscode-extension-patterns

### Notes

- Avatar state system is internal to WelcomeViewProvider — no external API changes
- Cognitive states are session-scoped; cleared on window reload
- Completes partial delivery of v5.9.1 roadmap "Alex persona images" P0 task (cognitive state portraits)

## [5.9.0] - 2026-02-19

> **VS Code API Adoption + Brain-QA Infrastructure** — Free platform leverage via 1.109 agent hooks, Copilot Memory, subagents, and Plan Agent; plus API key observability and synapse sync hardening

### Added

#### VS Code 1.109+ — Agent Hooks (P0)

- **`.github/hooks.json`** — VS Code agent lifecycle hook configuration: SessionStart, SessionStop, PreToolUse, PostToolUse
- **`session-start.js`** — Loads user profile, active goals, and meditation overdue status into session context on every agent session start
- **`session-stop.js`** — Appends session entry to `session-metrics.json`; suggests `/meditate` if session ran ≥30 minutes
- **`pre-tool-use.js`** — Safety gate: warns when restricted commands (Initialize/Reset Architecture) are attempted on Master Alex workspace
- **`post-tool-use.js`** — Logs tool name + success to `session-tool-log.json` for synapse activation analysis during meditation sessions
- All telemetry is **local only** — no data leaves the machine

#### VS Code 1.109+ — Copilot Memory (P0)

- **`copilot-instructions.md`** updated with Copilot Memory section: defines what belongs in memory vs. files vs. synapses
- **`.vscode/settings.json`** updated with `github.copilot.chat.copilotMemory.enabled: true`
- Memory curation added to meditation protocol: review and prune stale entries during `/meditate`

#### VS Code 1.109+ — Subagents (P1)

- All 6 specialist agents now have `user-invokable: true` for parallel subagent execution:
  - `alex-researcher.agent.md` — Deep domain research (Claude Opus 4)
  - `alex-builder.agent.md` — Implementation mode (Claude Sonnet 4)
  - `alex-validator.agent.md` — Adversarial QA (Claude Sonnet 4)
  - `alex-documentarian.agent.md` — Documentation mode (Claude Sonnet 4)
  - `alex-azure.agent.md` — Azure development (Claude Sonnet 4)
  - `alex-m365.agent.md` — M365/Teams development (Claude Sonnet 4)
- Settings added: `chat.customAgentInSubagent.enabled`, `github.copilot.chat.searchSubagent.enabled`

#### VS Code 1.109+ — Plan Agent (P1)

- **`/plan` prompt** (`plan.prompt.md`) — 4-phase structured implementation workflow: Discovery → Alignment → Design → Refinement
- Three Alex-specific plan templates: Architecture Refactoring, New Skill, Release Preparation
- Integrates with skill-selection-optimization for complex task planning

#### `.vscode/settings.json` — Full 1.109 Settings Block

- Added all recommended VS Code 1.109+ settings: `chat.hooks.enabled`, `copilotMemory`, subagent settings, request queuing, agents control
- Claude adaptive thinking: `claude-sonnet-4-*.adaptiveThinkingEnabled`
- Full documented config with inline comments

#### Phase 35 — API Key Availability Check (brain-qa.ps1)

- **New brain-qa phase** scans all `synapses.json` files for `apiKeys` declarations and checks each `envVar` at Process/User/Machine scope
- **Warns (never fails)** when a required key is missing — exit code stays 0; output shows skill names, purpose, and acquisition URL
- **`apiKeys` schema** added to `SYNAPSE-SCHEMA.json` — array of `{ envVar, purpose, required, getUrl }` objects
- **Two skills declared** their runtime API key requirements:
  - `ai-character-reference-generation` → `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` (Flux/Ideogram character image generation)
  - `ai-generated-readme-banners` → `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` (Ideogram v2 / Flux banner generation)

#### Meditation Consolidation — 2026-02-19 Brain-QA Healing Session

- **Episodic record** — `.github/episodic/meditation-2026-02-19-brain-qa-healing.md` created: 5 key insights, memory map table, synaptic connections from the 34→0 issue resolution sprint
- **`heir-sync-management` SKILL.md enhanced** — Added § Post-Rename Cascade Check with PowerShell discovery/repair/validation protocol
- **Synapse strengthened** — `heir-sync-management/synapses.json` v1.0.0→1.1.0, brain-qa connection strength 0.85→0.90

### Fixed

#### Phase 7 — Synapse Sync Detection Hardening

- **Root cause**: diff detection compared only connection *counts* — new top-level fields (e.g. `apiKeys`) silently failed to propagate to heir
- **Fix**: full content comparison using `ConvertTo-Json -Compress` after filtering master-only connections — any field change now triggers a sync
- **Impact**: `apiKeys` correctly propagated to heir for both Replicate skill synapse files

### Notes

- Extension package version bumped to `5.9.0`
- All changes synced to VS Code heir via brain-qa -Mode sync -Fix
- Hook scripts are Node.js (no new dependencies); graceful no-ops when optional context files are absent
- `user-invokable: true` on specialist agents requires VS Code 1.109+ Copilot — no-op on older versions

---

## [5.8.5] - 2026-02-19

> **Cognitive Architecture Enhancement** — Trifecta completion sprint, skill discoverability enrichment, and staleness management expansion

### Added

#### Trifecta Completion Sprint (+9 complete trifectas — 22 total)

- **Platform enrichment**: markdown-mermaid (ATACCU, diagram not rendering), testing-strategies (testing pyramid, AAA pattern, flaky tests), knowledge-synthesis (save this globally, promote to pattern)
- **Existing thin skills**: llm-model-selection, security-review, privacy-responsible-ai (EU AI Act, GDPR), git-workflow (worktrees, cherry-pick), debugging-patterns, root-cause-analysis, architecture-health, global-knowledge, prompt-engineering, error-recovery-patterns, api-design
- **Stale entry removed**: `microsoft-sfi` row deleted from index (already consolidated into `security-review`)

#### Staleness Management Expansion

- **16 staleness-prone skills tracked** in SKILLS-CATALOG.md (expanded from 8) with Why Stale, Refresh Triggers, Owner, and Last Updated columns
- **8 new entries added**: gamma-presentations (SaaS product evolution), mcp-development (spec actively versioned), microsoft-fabric (monthly feature releases), fabric-notebook-publish (Git integration maturing), microsoft-graph-api (beta→v1.0 graduation), bicep-avm-mastery (AVM registry monthly updates), foundry-agent-platform (preview architecture shifts), ai-character-reference-generation (model version deprecation)

#### Skill Content Refresh (6 skills updated with staleness headers + corrections)

- **mcp-development** (v1.0.0→1.1.0) — Transport section rewritten: deprecated HTTP+SSE replaced by Streamable HTTP (MCP spec 2025-03-26); `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` code example added; three references to `HTTP+SSE` corrected throughout (terminology table, ASCII diagram, transport section)
- **gamma-presentations** — Staleness watch header added: API v0.2, monitors content types, credit pricing, theme updates
- **microsoft-fabric** — Staleness watch header added: REST API v1 stable, new endpoints monthly; links to Fabric release notes
- **fabric-notebook-publish** — Staleness watch header + Last Validated (Feb 2026): notes Git integration scope gaps (not all item types support Git sync)
- **bicep-avm-mastery** (v1.0.0→1.1.0) — Staleness watch added; advises using live `mcp_bicep_list_avm_metadata` over hardcoded module counts
- **ai-character-reference-generation** — Staleness watch added: Replicate model deprecation risk, `flux-1.1-pro-ultra` surfaced as upgrade path

### Notes

- No extension code changes — pure cognitive architecture and documentation release
- All changes synced to VS Code heir platform

---

## [5.8.4] - 2026-02-19

> **Secrets Management** — Comprehensive credential security with VS Code SecretStorage API, .env file detection, and platform-native encrypted storage

### Added

- **VS Code SecretStorage API integration** — Platform-native encrypted storage (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
- **Token configuration registry** — 5 supported tokens: GitHub, Gamma, Replicate, OpenAI, Anthropic with metadata (displayName, description, getUrl, placeholder, envVar)
- **Synchronous access pattern** — Token cache (Map) enables sync retrieval from async SecretStorage
- **Token management UI** — Quick pick interface showing all tokens with status indicators ($(check)/$(x))
- **Password-masked input** — Input boxes use `password: true` for secure token entry
- **"Get API Key" button** — Opens service URL directly from input prompt for easy token acquisition

#### Environment Variable Migration

- **Automatic migration** — Detects env vars (process.env) and copies to SecretStorage on extension activation
- **Initialize integration** — Migrates secrets when deploying Alex to new projects
- **Upgrade integration** — Migrates secrets when upgrading existing Alex installations
- **Non-destructive strategy** — Keeps env vars as fallback, never overwrites user-configured tokens
- **Backward compatibility** — Falls back to env vars if SecretStorage empty, ensuring zero-breaking changes

#### .env File Detection & Migration 🆕

- **Workspace scanning** — `alex.detectEnvSecrets` command scans all .env files for credentials
- **Regex-based parsing** — Pattern: `/^\s*([A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*)\s*=\s*([^#\n]+)/i` with keyword matching
- **Secret keyword detection** — Identifies: API_KEY, TOKEN, SECRET, PASSWORD, PASS, AUTH, CREDENTIAL, PRIVATE_KEY
- **Smart exclusions** — Skips .env.example, .env.template, .env.sample, and node_modules
- **Token classification** — Distinguishes recognized tokens (matches TOKEN_CONFIGS) from custom secrets
- **Auto-migration** — One-click migration of recognized tokens (e.g., GAMMA_API_KEY) to SecretStorage
- **Manual review UI** — Multi-select quick pick for custom secrets requiring user review

#### Feature Integration

- **Gamma commands updated** — All 3 gamma commands (alex.generateGammaPresentations, alex.convertToGamma, alex.generateGammaDiagram) now use SecretStorage
- **Warning templates** — Missing token warnings include "Configure API Key" button that opens management UI
- **telemetry integration** — All secrets commands tracked with telemetry.logTimed()

### Changed

- **Token retrieval pattern** — Features now call `getToken()` instead of direct `process.env` access
- **Sync access enabled** — Pre-loaded cache allows synchronous token retrieval without await
- **Platform-agnostic security** — OS-level encryption on all platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux)

### Security

- **OS-encrypted storage** — Credentials stored in platform keyring, not plaintext files
- **Reduced git commit risk** — Proactive .env scanning prevents accidental credential commits
- **No token logging** — getToken() implementations redact tokens from console output
- **Password input masking** — All token entry UIs use masked input for visual security

### Added

#### Prompt Engine Enhancements (v5.8.2 — P2: Personality Polish)

- **Layer 9: Knowledge Context** — @alex pre-searches Global Knowledge for relevant patterns/insights based on query terms before responding (~200 tokens)
  - Extracts top 5 key terms from user query (filtering stop words)
  - Searches Global Knowledge index for top 3 relevant entries
  - Compresses results to title + 1-sentence summary
  - Injects relevant context to inform response before model sees the question
- **Enhanced Layer 2: Persona-Driven Prompts** — @alex adapts communication style based on detected project persona (~150 tokens, was ~80)
  - Reads persona from Active Context (Developer, Academic, Researcher, etc.)
  - Injects persona-specific tone guidance (e.g., "Pragmatic, code-focused" for Developer)
  - Shows recommended skill for detected persona
  - Displays project banner noun (CODE, THESIS, RESEARCH, etc.)
- **Enhanced Layer 10: Confidence Signaling** — @alex indicates confidence level in responses (~250 tokens, was ~200)
  - **High confidence**: Direct answer with certainty ("This is...", "The solution is...")
  - **Medium confidence**: Qualified answer ("Based on X, this likely...", "Typically...")
  - **Low confidence**: Tentative answer ("I think...", "It might be...", "Consider...")

- **TypeScript compilation** — Removed orphaned disposable registrations for deleted sync commands
- **Console statement cleanup** — Removed 27 non-critical logs while preserving 18 legitimate ones:
  - `setupEnvironment.ts`: 8 setup progress logs
  - `upgrade.ts`: 7 migration debugging logs
  - `personaDetection.ts`: 5 LLM detection logs
  - `initialize.ts`: 3 initialization logs
  - `goals.ts`: 1 cleanup count log

### Changed

## [5.6.9] - 2026-02-14

> **Semantic Signals + Visual Polish** — Persona detection uses regex-based semantic rules; Mermaid diagrams adopt GitHub Pastel v2; Codespaces heir documented

### Changed

- **Persona detection: semantic signal architecture** — Replaced flat keyword/techStack/projectPatterns arrays with unified `PersonaSignal` system. Each signal has a category (identity, technology, structure, dependency, content), regex pattern, and per-signal weight. All 16 personas now defined via `buildPersona()` with weighted semantic rules instead of substring matching
- **Priority 1-4 detection helpers** — `detectFromFocusSession()`, `detectFromSessionGoals()`, `detectFromProjectPhase()`, and `detectFromProjectGoals()` rewritten to use `matchTextAgainstSignals()` with regex matching
- **Priority 6 scoring loop** — Profile analysis (tech, goals, expertise, projects) and workspace scanning now iterate signal categories with regex. Dependency and content signals enable deeper detection without LLM fallback
- **Mermaid diagram palette** — All 6 Mermaid blocks across 5 documentation files updated to GitHub Pastel v2 with `%%{init}%%` directive, `classDef` semantic coloring, and `linkStyle default` stroke

---

## [5.6.8] - 2026-02-12

> **Heir Decontamination RCA + Persona Detection Fix** — sync-architecture.js prevents PII leaks; persona detection no longer false-positives on `.github/`

### Fixed

- **Persona pattern matching bug** — Bidirectional substring match (`patternNormalized.includes(entryLower)`) caused `.github/workflows/` to match any `.github/` directory, falsely scoring DevOps for every Alex project. Replaced with typed matching: `fs.pathExists()` for path patterns, `endsWith()` for extensions, exact Set lookup for filenames
- **Noisy `.github/` signal** — Removed `.github/` from power-user `projectPatterns` (every Alex-initialized project has it)
- **RC1: Blind config copy** — `copyDirRecursive()` now excludes `user-profile.json`, `MASTER-ALEX-PROTECTED.json`, `cognitive-config.json` from heir
- **RC2: Master-specific content in copilot-instructions.md** — `applyHeirTransformations()` resets P5-P7 slots, removes "Master Alex default" line, fixes skill counts dynamically, resets "Last Assessed"
- **RC3: Broken synapse references** — `HEIR_SYNAPSE_REMOVALS` strips ROADMAP-UNIFIED.md synapse from release-management.instructions.md
- **RC4: No post-sync validation** — `validateHeirIntegrity()` blocks publish if PII, master-only files, or master content detected
- **CRLF regex** — All heir transformation patterns now handle Windows line endings
- **Ignore file hardening** — Added `cognitive-config.json` and `MASTER-ALEX-PROTECTED.json` to both `.gitignore` and `.vscodeignore`

### Added

### Fixed

- **microsoft-graph-api synapses** — Schema v1.0 (bare skill IDs) upgraded to v2.1.0 (full `.github/skills/` paths)
- **7 missing skills in activation index** — bicep-avm-mastery, database-design, microsoft-graph-api, multi-agent-orchestration, observability-monitoring, performance-profiling, skill-development
- **Source code path references** — 5 `platforms/vscode-extension/src/` references in instruction files converted to "External Implementation" notes
- **Broken synapse targets** — Removed `alex_docs/`, `article/`, `platforms/src/`, `ROADMAP-UNIFIED.md` references from 12 synapse.json files
- **brain-qa.ps1** — Validation pattern tightened to reject external paths outside `.github/`

### Security

- **getUserProfile() in-memory defaults** — Returns template defaults without creating files
  - Supports conversational profile discovery for new users

### Removed

- **Mail.Send capability** — Removed `sendMail()` from Microsoft Graph integration
  - Corporate tenant blocks made it unusable
  - Safer for users (no email sending permission needed)

### Changed

- **Graph/M365 skills synced** — `microsoft-graph-api`, `m365-agent-debugging`, `teams-app-patterns` now in both master and heir
