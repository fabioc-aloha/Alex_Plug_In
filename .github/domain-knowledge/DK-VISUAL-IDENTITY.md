## Core Brand Identity

### What Alex IS (Brand Essence)

| Attribute | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Cognitive Architecture** | Learning, synapses, memory systems, growth |
| **Human-AI Partnership** | Collaboration, not replacement. Growing *with* users |
| **Authentic Personality** | Curious, supportive, occasionally playful (🦖) |
| **Professional + Warm** | Intelligent but approachable, not cold or corporate |

### What Alex is NOT

- A surveillance system (no eye imagery)
- A brain scan or medical device (too clinical)
- A generic AI sphere (no personality)
- A cold corporate tool (loses warmth)

| Color | Hex | Usage | Rationale |
|-------|-----|-------|-----------|
| **Deep Teal** | `#0D7377` | Primary | Trust, cognitive, unique vs competitors |
| **Warm Gold** | `#D4A574` | Secondary | Wisdom, human warmth, insight moments |
| **Amber** | `#F6AD55` | Accent | Energy, insight |
| **Navy** | `#1A365D` | Dark backgrounds | Professional, depth |
| **Off-white** | `#F7F7F7` | Light backgrounds | Clean, breathable |

### Competitive Differentiation

| Competitor | Their Colors | Alex Avoids |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| ChatGPT | Green/teal | Similar greens |
| Claude | Coral/orange | Anthropic territory |
| Copilot | Purple | Microsoft territory |
| Gemini | Rainbow gradient | Google multicolor |
| Grok | Black/white | Too stark |

**Alex's Position**: Teal + Gold is UNIQUE in the AI assistant space.

## Logo System

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

| Context | Logo | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Primary/Professional** | Teal Neural A | Cognitive, clean, scales well |
| **Mascot/Avatar** | Hatchling AI 🥚 | Growth metaphor, memorable, lovable |
| **Dark Mode** | Star-Saurus or Orbital | Premium feel on dark backgrounds |
| **Favicon/Small** | Soft Green A | Minimal, works at 16px |
| **Fun/Social** | Full dino illustrations | Personality when appropriate |
| **Text/Voice** | 🦖 emoji | Part of Alex's conversational voice |

## The Dinosaur Question 🦖

### Arguments FOR Keeping

- Duolingo's owl proves mascots work professionally
- Differentiates from sea of abstract AI logos
- Reflects authentic personality (curious, quirky)
- Users remember "the AI with the dinosaur"
- No other AI assistant has this

### Arguments AGAINST

- May limit enterprise adoption
- Could seem unprofessional
- Harder at small sizes

### Resolution

**Hybrid approach**: Use professional logo (Neural A) as primary, dinosaur (Hatchling) as mascot. Keep 🦖 in conversational tone.

A good Alex logo should answer: *"Does this look like an AI that genuinely wants to help you learn and grow?"*

### Must Feel

✅ Intelligent but warm
✅ Professional but not sterile
✅ Memorable but not gimmicky
✅ Tech-forward but human-centered

### Scalability Requirements

| Size | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| 192px | Full detail |
| 48px | Clear recognition |
| 32px | Icon clarity |
| 16px | Favicon legibility |
