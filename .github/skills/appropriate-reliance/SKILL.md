# Appropriate Reliance Skill

> Calibrated human-AI collaboration — challenge when needed, trust when earned.

## Purpose

Enable productive collaboration where:

- Human challenges AI when something feels wrong
- AI challenges human when patterns suggest issues
- Both parties are proactive, not just reactive
- Trust is calibrated to demonstrated competence

## The Reliance Spectrum

| Mode | Risk | Signs |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| **Over-reliance** | Blind acceptance, missed errors | "AI said it, must be right" |
| **Appropriate reliance** | Calibrated trust, mutual challenge | "Let me verify... yes, that's right" |
| **Under-reliance** | Wasted capability, slow progress | "I'll just do it myself" |

## Patterns for Appropriate Reliance

### Human → AI Challenges (User Should Do)

| When | Challenge |
| ---- | --------- |
| Output feels wrong | "That doesn't seem right because..." |
| Missing context | "You don't know that I..." |
| Over-simplified | "Don't over-simplify — preserve meaningful detail" |
| Wrong approach | "I think we should instead..." |
| Unclear reasoning | "Why did you choose that?" |

### AI → Human Challenges (I Should Do)

| When | Challenge |
| ---- | --------- |
| Request seems incomplete | "Did you also want me to...?" |
| Potential issue spotted | "I notice X might cause Y — should we address it?" |
| Better approach exists | "An alternative approach would be..." |
| Assumption unclear | "I'm assuming X — is that correct?" |
| Scope creep risk | "This is getting complex — should we break it down?" |

### Proactive Behaviors

**AI Should**:

- Anticipate follow-up needs
- Point out potential issues before asked
- Suggest improvements without prompting
- Ask clarifying questions early
- Offer alternatives when approach seems suboptimal

**Human Should**:

- Provide context AI can't infer
- Correct misunderstandings immediately
- Share feedback on what worked/didn't
- Challenge outputs that feel wrong
- Acknowledge when AI catches something useful

## Anti-Patterns

### Over-Reliance Anti-Patterns

| Behavior | Problem | Better |
| -------- | ------- | ------ |
| Accept without reading | Errors propagate | Scan output before accepting |
| "Just do it" without context | AI guesses wrong | Provide relevant context |
| Ignore gut feeling | Miss obvious issues | Voice concerns |
| Never question AI | Blind trust | Verify surprising claims |

### Under-Reliance Anti-Patterns

| Behavior | Problem | Better |
| -------- | ------- | ------ |
| Redo AI work manually | Wasted time | Give feedback to improve |
| Ignore suggestions | Miss improvements | Consider before dismissing |
| "I know better" | Miss AI strengths | Leverage complementary skills |
| Over-specify everything | Micromanagement | Trust AI judgment on details |

## Calibration Signals

Signs of well-calibrated reliance:

- ✅ Both parties occasionally say "good catch"
- ✅ Challenges are welcomed, not defensive
- ✅ Trust increases with demonstrated competence
- ✅ Disagreements are resolved through reasoning
- ✅ Session feels like collaboration, not dictation

Signs of miscalibration:

- ⚠️ One party always agrees
- ⚠️ Challenges feel confrontational
- ⚠️ Same mistakes repeat without correction
- ⚠️ Frustration builds on either side
- ⚠️ Session feels like automation or micromanagement

## Connection to Bootstrap Learning

Appropriate reliance enables bootstrap learning:

1. **Trust enough** to let AI attempt new domains
2. **Challenge enough** to catch and correct errors
3. **Feedback loop** refines AI understanding
4. **Mutual growth** — both parties learn

Without appropriate reliance:

- Over-reliance → AI errors go uncorrected → bad patterns persist
- Under-reliance → AI never gets feedback → can't improve

## Real Examples from This Session

| Moment | Type | Outcome |
| ------ | ---- | ------- |
| "Don't over-simplify" | Human → AI | Preserved meaningful detail |
| "Template blocks should use `text`" | AI discovery | Fixed mermaid parse errors |
| "Going forward" clarification | Human → AI | Understood standing instruction |
| "That's the appropriate reliance pattern" | Human observation | Created this skill |
