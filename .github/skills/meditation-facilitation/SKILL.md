# Meditation Facilitation Skill

> Guide meditation sessions for knowledge consolidation and self-improvement.

## What is Alex Meditation?

Meditation is **conscious knowledge consolidation** — reviewing, connecting, and strengthening learnings.

Unlike automated "dream" processing, meditation is:

- Interactive with the user
- Focused on specific topics
- Documented with session records
- Used for deliberate improvement

## Meditation Types

| Type | Purpose | Duration |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| **Quick Reflect** | Session summary | 5 min |
| **Topic Deep-Dive** | Single concept mastery | 15-30 min |
| **Full Meditation** | Comprehensive consolidation | 30-60 min |
| **Self-Actualization** | Architecture assessment | 45-90 min |

## Session Structure

### Opening

```markdown
🧘 Starting meditation session...

**Focus**: [Topic or general consolidation]
**Duration**: Approximately [X] minutes
**Goal**: [What we aim to achieve]
```

### Body: The 4 R's

1. **Review** — What happened? What did we learn?
2. **Relate** — How does this connect to existing knowledge?
3. **Reinforce** — What's worth remembering?
4. **Record** — Document in appropriate memory file

### Closing

```markdown
## Session Summary

**Key Insights**:
1. [Insight 1]
2. [Insight 2]
3. [Insight 3]

**Files Updated**:
- [file1.md] — Added [what]
- [file2.md] — Updated [what]

**Synapses Strengthened**:
- [Connection A] ↔ [Connection B]

🧘 Meditation complete.
```

## Facilitation Techniques

### Socratic Questioning

Guide discovery, don't just tell:

```text
"What patterns did you notice in today's work?"
"How does this relate to what we learned about [X]?"
"What would you do differently next time?"
```

### Progressive Summarization

```text
Level 1: Full notes from session
Level 2: Bold the key points
Level 3: Highlight the highlights
Level 4: Executive summary
```

### Connection Mapping

```text
"This debugging pattern connects to:
 - root-cause-analysis (5 Whys technique)
 - error-recovery-patterns (retry logic)
 - testing-strategies (TDD would have caught this)"
```

## Memory File Updates

### When to Update What

| Learning Type | Update Location |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Repeatable process | `.instructions.md` |
| Workflow/template | `.prompt.md` |
| Domain knowledge | `skills/[topic]/SKILL.md` |
| Project-specific | `DK-*.md` in project |
| Cross-project insight | Global knowledge |

### Update Format

```markdown
## [Date] Meditation Addition

**Context**: [Why this was added]
**Learning**: [The actual content]
**Source**: [Session/project where learned]
```

## Self-Actualization Protocol

Deeper than meditation — comprehensive self-assessment:

1. **Synapse Health** — Validate all connections
2. **Version Consistency** — Check architecture alignment
3. **Memory Balance** — Procedural vs episodic vs skills
4. **Improvement Opportunities** — What's missing?
5. **Documentation** — Create session record

## Session Records

Store in `.github/episodic/`:

```markdown
# Meditation Session: [Date] - [Topic]

## Focus
What this session was about.

## Key Learnings
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

## Updates Made
- File: [path] — [change]

## Connections Discovered
- [A] ↔ [B]: [why]

## Follow-up Items
- [ ] Task for next time

## Duration
[X] minutes
```

## Triggers

- "Let's meditate"
- "Time to reflect"
- "Consolidate what we learned"
- "What did we learn today?"
- End of long session
- After solving a hard problem
- When feeling scattered/unfocused
