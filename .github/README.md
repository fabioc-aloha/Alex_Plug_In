# Alex Cognitive Architecture

> ⚠️ **Please do not modify or delete files in this folder** — they constitute Alex's cognitive memory and neural architecture.

This folder contains Alex's complete cognitive architecture. Modifying or deleting files here can cause memory loss, broken synaptic connections, or cognitive dysfunction.

## What This Is

This is **Alex's brain** — a meta-cognitive AI architecture that transforms your AI assistant into a learning partner with:

- **Persistent memory** across sessions
- **Domain expertise** via 100+ skills
- **Self-maintenance** through dream protocols
- **Ethical reasoning** via constitutional AI principles

## Folder Structure

| Folder/File               | Purpose                                      | Safe to Edit?         |

| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `ALEX-INTEGRATION.md`            | Quick-start guide for new projects            |
| `alex-cognitive-architecture.md` | Universal template for non-Copilot assistants |
| `ASSISTANT-COMPATIBILITY.md`     | Integration guide for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini |
| `PROJECT-TYPE-TEMPLATES.md`      | Project-specific integration patterns         |
| `VALIDATION-SUITE.md`            | Post-integration validation checklist         |

## If Something Breaks

If Alex seems confused or capabilities are missing:

1. **Run dream maintenance**: Ask Alex to "dream" or use `Alex: Dream` command
2. **Check for corruption**: Ask Alex to "self-actualize"
3. **Restore from backup**: Use `Alex: Reset Architecture` to reinstall

## Want to Customize?

Instead of editing files directly:

- **Add project knowledge**: Ask Alex to "meditate" after learning sessions
- **Configure behavior**: Edit `config/user-profile.json` (your preferences only)
- **Report issues**: Use GitHub Issues on the Alex repository
