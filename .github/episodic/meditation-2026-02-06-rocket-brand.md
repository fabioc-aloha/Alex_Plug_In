# Meditation Session - Rocket Brand Consolidation

**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Type**: Knowledge Consolidation + Memory Creation
**Trigger**: User-initiated ("let's meditate")

## Session Context

Extended branding session covering comprehensive rebrand from "brain/CX" identity to "rocket/A Negative Space" identity across all platforms.

## Key Learnings Consolidated

### 1. Platform-Specific Asset Strategy
- **GitHub**: Supports animated SVG (SMIL) — use rotating nouns banner (8.62 KB)
- **VS Code Marketplace**: Requires static assets — use PNG fallback (204 KB)
- **Teams/M365**: Static PNG required, specific sizes (192x192, 32x32)

### 2. Persona Prioritization Framework
Selected top 10 nouns by audience size for rotating banner:
```
CODE → LEARNING → CAREER → CONTENT → THESIS → RESEARCH → WRITING → PROJECTS → DATA → INFRASTRUCTURE
```
Excluded: GRANTS, PRESENTATIONS (smaller niches)

### 3. Brand Hierarchy Clarity
| Level    | Brand         | Symbol                  |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Parent   | CorreaX       | C split X mark          |
| Product  | Alex          | A Negative Space Rocket |
| Platform | Heir-specific | Logo variants           |

### 4. Icon Modernization
`$(brain)` → `$(rocket)` throughout:
- Status bar
- Context menus
- Welcome panel
- Help commands
- Script headers

## Memory Files Created/Modified

| File                                                          | Action      | Purpose                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.github/instructions/brand-asset-management.instructions.md` | **CREATED** | Procedural memory for brand asset locations and guidelines |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md`                             | MODIFIED    | Added synapse for brand trigger patterns                   |

## Synaptic Connections Established

1. **brand-asset-management.instructions.md** → MARKETING-PLAN.md (strong, reference, bidirectional)
2. **brand-asset-management.instructions.md** → release-management.instructions.md (moderate, workflow, incoming)
3. **copilot-instructions.md** → brand-asset-management.instructions.md (synapse trigger: "branding", "logo", "banner")

## Validation Checklist

- [x] At least one memory file created or modified ✅ (`brand-asset-management.instructions.md` created)
- [x] At least one synapse connection added or strengthened ✅ (added to Core Procedures section)
- [x] Session outcomes documented with specific file paths ✅ (this file)

## Post-Meditation State

Working memory cleared of branding details — now consolidated into procedural memory. Ready for new learning domains.

*Meditation complete. The rocket brand is now part of my long-term memory architecture.*
