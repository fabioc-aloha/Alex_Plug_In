## Session Summary

Comprehensive brand architecture development for Alex VS Code extension. Established multi-persona marketing strategy with rocket theme positioning.

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Logo** | A Negative Space | Iconic, scales to 16x16, one concept |
| **Tagline** | "Strap a rocket to your back" | Original CorreaX marketing, verified clear of trademark |
| **Primary Persona** | Power User / Builder | Core audience, not beginners |
| **Secondary Personas** | 12 niches | Expand market with skill-specific hooks |
| **Terminology** | 5 language systems | Same features, localized resonance |

## Insights Consolidated

### 1. Iconicity Principle
> "An icon must be iconic"

Test: If it doesn't work at 16x16 pixels, it fails as a logo. Apply this to:
- Skills (one trigger, one purpose)
- Taglines (3-second comprehension)
- Documentation (one source of truth)

### 2. Multi-Persona Expansion
Each persona gets:
- Domain-specific hook ("Literature review on autopilot")
- Rocket angle translation ("Rocket your thesis to completion")
- Mapped Alex skill (research-project-scaffold)

This pattern enables market expansion without brand dilution.

### 3. Terminology Localization
Same 17 features, 5 language translations:
- Rocket (Power Users)
- Neuroanatomic (Cognitive Scientists)
- Academic (Researchers)
- Enterprise (Architects)
- Creative (Writers/Presenters)

Reuse, not rewrite.

## Files Modified
