# Meditation: Methodology Publication Readiness

**Date**: February 5, 2026
**Type**: Knowledge Consolidation + Skill Creation
**Duration**: Extended session

---

## Session Summary

This session focused on finalizing the AI-ASSISTED-DEVELOPMENT-METHODOLOGY.md paper and capturing Fabio's research methodology as a reusable skill.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Skill Creation: practitioner-research

Created `.github/skills/practitioner-research/` capturing Fabio's longitudinal case study methodology:

- **Ship → Document → Promote** workflow
- Structured abstracts (Background/Objective/Method/Results/Contributions/Significance)
- Part I (Universal) / Part II (Practitioner) document architecture
- Visual research standards with Mermaid
- APA 7 citation and fact-checking protocols
- Prior Art vs Novel Contributions tables

**Trigger words**: research, methodology, case study, longitudinal, publication, evidence, prior art, structured abstract, fact-check

### 2. Academic Rigor Enhancements

Added to methodology paper:
- **Threats to Validity** section (internal, external, construct)
- **Dual closing paragraphs** (academic version, blog/practitioner version)
- **Appendix E: Getting Started** (10-minute reproducibility guide)
- **Appendix F: Publication Strategy** (4 venue options with decision flowchart)
- **Expiration note** on competitive analysis (Feb 2026 snapshot)

### 3. Reference Improvements

Updated all arXiv references to proper DOI format:
- `arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX` → `doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX`
- Added SSRN DOI for Dell'Acqua et al.
- Added ISBN for Forsgren et al. book
- Fixed TMLR publication links

### 4. Heir Payload Fix

Removed broken `CHANGELOG.md` synapse from heir episodic memory:
- Root cause: Master-specific file referenced in inherited meditation record
- Solution: Removed Documentation-Identity Integration section
- Result: Heirs now have 136/136 healthy synapses (100%)

### 5. Visual Learning Discovery

**Insight**: Mermaid xychart-beta doesn't support per-bar colors (only multiple data series get different colors).

**Solution**: Replaced monochrome bar chart with:
1. Pie chart with proper theming (pie1-pie5 variables)
2. ASCII bar table with emojis for task identification

This pattern is now documented in practitioner-research skill.

## Synaptic Connections

- [practitioner-research/SKILL.md] (1.0, created, forward) - "New skill capturing Fabio's research methodology"
- [AI-ASSISTED-DEVELOPMENT-METHODOLOGY.md] (0.95, enhances, bidirectional) - "Publication-ready methodology paper"
- [markdown-mermaid/SKILL.md] (0.7, informs, forward) - "xychart-beta color limitation discovered"
- [academic-research/SKILL.md] (0.85, extends, bidirectional) - "Practitioner-research extends academic-research"

## Working Memory State

### Cleared from Working Memory
- Methodology paper publication readiness tasks
- Heir synapse health issues
- Bar chart coloring issues

### Retained in Working Memory
- Publication venue decision (undecided by user)
- Potential future external validation study

## Cognitive Architecture Updates

| Component         | Change                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Skills            | +1 (practitioner-research)        |
| Episodic          | +1 (this meditation)              |
| Methodology paper | +157 lines (academic sections)    |
| Heir payload      | -3 lines (broken synapse removed) |

## Post-Meditation Assessment

- ✅ Memory file created (this meditation record)
- ✅ Synapse connections documented
- ✅ Session outcomes recorded with file paths

**Meditation Status**: COMPLETE
