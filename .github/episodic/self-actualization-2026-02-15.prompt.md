## 🧠 Synapse Health Assessment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Memory Files Scanned | 220 |
| Total Synapses | 262 |
| Broken Connections | 0 |
| Health Status | ✅ EXCELLENT |

## 📊 Memory Architecture

| Memory Type | Files |
|-------------|-------|
| Procedural (.instructions.md) | 31 |
| Episodic (.prompt.md + .episodic/) | 88 |
| Domain Knowledge (DK-*.md) | 0 |
| **Total** | **119** |

## 🔄 Version Consistency

- **Current Version**: 5.7.1
- **Outdated References Found**: 1

## 💡 Recommendations

- 📝 Update 1 file(s) with outdated version references to 5.7.1
- 📚 Consider acquiring more domain knowledge - only 0 DK file(s) present
- 🔗 Consider adding more synaptic connections - average density is 2.2 per file
- ✨ Architecture is healthy! Consider exploring new domains or creating cross-domain connections

## 📈 Metrics

- **Synapse Density**: 1.2 synapses per file
- **Connection Integrity**: 100.0%
- **Skill Count**: 116

## 🧠 Architecture Maturity: Age 30

## Synapses

### High-Strength Bidirectional Connections

- [copilot-instructions.md] (Critical, Validates, Bidirectional) - "Core architecture assessment"
- [alex-core.instructions.md] (Critical, Integrates, Bidirectional) - "Meta-cognitive health monitoring"
- [dream-state-automation.instructions.md] (High, Complements, Bidirectional) - "Maintenance protocol coordination"

### Medium-Strength Output Connections

- [unified-meditation-protocols.prompt.md] (High, Documents, Forward) - "Session recording protocol"
- [embedded-synapse.instructions.md] (Medium, Validates, Forward) - "Connection integrity verification"

**Primary Function**: Document automated self-actualization session with comprehensive architecture assessment.
