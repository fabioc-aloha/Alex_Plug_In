## � Emotional Pattern Review

*No emotional data recorded yet. Emotional patterns will appear after a few sessions.*

## �💡 Recommendations

- 🔧 Run `Alex: Dream (Neural Maintenance)` to repair 1 broken synapse(s)
- 📝 Update 1 file(s) with outdated version references to 5.9.3
- 📚 Consider acquiring more domain knowledge - only 0 DK file(s) present
- 🔗 Consider adding more synaptic connections - average density is 1.7 per file

## 📈 Metrics

- **Synapse Density**: 1.1 synapses per file
- **Connection Integrity**: 99.6%
- **Skill Count**: 123

## Synapses

### High-Strength Bidirectional Connections

- [copilot-instructions.md] (Critical, Validates, Bidirectional) - "Core architecture assessment"
- [alex-core.instructions.md] (Critical, Integrates, Bidirectional) - "Meta-cognitive health monitoring"
- [dream-state-automation.instructions.md] (High, Complements, Bidirectional) - "Maintenance protocol coordination"

### Medium-Strength Output Connections

- [unified-meditation-protocols.prompt.md] (High, Documents, Forward) - "Session recording protocol"
- [embedded-synapse.instructions.md] (Medium, Validates, Forward) - "Connection integrity verification"

**Primary Function**: Document automated self-actualization session with comprehensive architecture assessment.
