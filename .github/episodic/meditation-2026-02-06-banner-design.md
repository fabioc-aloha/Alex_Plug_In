**Session Type**: Creative Design + Brand Architecture
**Duration**: Extended branding session (continuation)

## Session Summary

- Subtle **CorreaX** parent brand placement
- Rocket-themed visuals (flames, stars, thrust trails)

## Synaptic Connections Strengthened

```
[MARKETING-PLAN.md] → (strong, visual-branding, bidirectional) → [banner-concepts/*.svg]
[a-negative-space.svg] → (strong, visual-identity, feeds-into) → [banner-concepts/*.svg]
[CorreaX logo.svg] → (moderate, parent-brand, feeds-into) → [banner-concepts/*.svg]

## Design Insights

1. **CX Placement Strategy**: Tested 4 approaches for parent brand visibility
   - Bottom corner (text only) — least obtrusive
   - Bottom corner (logo + text) — subtle but present
   - Centered footer — balanced
   - Within design — integrated but risks competition with Alex

2. **Banner Style Spectrum**: Created range from minimalist (v4) to epic (v6) to provide options for different marketplace strategies

3. **Theme Consistency**: All banners maintain:
   - Dark space backgrounds (fits rocket theme)
   - Azure blue (#0078d4) as primary
   - Thrust orange (#ff6b35) for flames
   - Clean typography (Segoe UI)
