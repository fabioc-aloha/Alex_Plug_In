# Learn — Moved to AlexLearn Heir

> **All teaching content has moved to the dedicated AlexLearn heir project.**

## Location

```
c:\Development\AlexLearn
```

## Why

The `learn/` folder is now maintained in the **AlexLearn** heir — a standalone project dedicated to teaching, demoing, and workshopping Alex for different personas (business knowledge workers, academics, researchers, content creators, etc.).

This keeps Master Alex focused on extension development while AlexLearn evolves independently as a self-sufficient teaching workspace.

## What's There

| Content | File |
|---------|------|
| Facilitator guide | `learn/README.md` |
| Minute-by-minute plan | `learn/SESSION-PLAN.md` |
| 43-slide Marp deck | `learn/SLIDES.md` |
| 8 step-by-step demos | `learn/DEMO-SCRIPTS.md` |
| Participant handout | `learn/PARTICIPANT-HANDOUT.md` |
| 3 guided exercises | `learn/EXERCISES.md` |
| Persona workshops | `workshops/` |
| Teaching trifecta | `.github/skills/workshop-facilitation/` |

## Sync Direction

```
AlexLearn (source of truth) → Master Alex (reference only, if needed)
```

The heir owns all teaching content. Master Alex does not maintain a copy.
