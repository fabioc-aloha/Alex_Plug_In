## Summary

Research on calibrating human-AI trust: knowing when to rely on AI output and when to verify independently.

**Key Concepts**:
- Over-reliance vs under-reliance patterns
- Behavioral telemetry for measuring reliance
- Edit distance ratios and verification patterns
- Calibrated confidence framework
