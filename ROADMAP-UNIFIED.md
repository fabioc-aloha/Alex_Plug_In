## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Failed | New Approach |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Separate roadmaps per platform | Led to divergent identities | Unified roadmap |
| Platform as "version" | M365 was "v4.x" while VS Code was "v3.x" | Heirs inherit from Master |
| Two `.github/` folders | No source of truth | Root is canonical, extension generated |
| Sync scripts | Complexity, failures | Build script (one direction) |
| Independent feature development | Platforms diverged | Features designed for both |
