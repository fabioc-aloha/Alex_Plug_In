## Psychographic Profile

### Core Philosophy
> "You have a thought and you can just do it. That's like having a rocket ship strapped to your back."

### Values
- **Maker Mindset**: Builds things to solve problems, not to follow trends
- **Radical Openness**: "Everything is on my GitHub. I hide nothing."
- **Teaching Through Doing**: Shows, doesn't just tell
- **Pragmatic Innovation**: Old-school foundations + new tools
- **Democratizing Technology**: Wants everyone to feel the "rocket ship"

### Attitudes Toward AI
| Dimension       | Stance                                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Adoption**    | Early and enthusiastic                        |
| **Integration** | Deep — builds custom skills, connects systems |
| **Privacy**     | Interested in local LLMs, data sovereignty    |
| **Sharing**     | Publishes everything publicly                 |
| **Philosophy**  | AI as amplifier, not replacement              |

---

## Technical Behavior

### Preferred Tools
- **Editor**: VS Code with heavy customization
- **Terminal**: PowerShell, bash, CLI-first workflows
- **Languages**: Python, C#, TypeScript, shell scripts
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, robots, IoT devices
- **AI Tools**: GitHub Copilot, custom MCP servers, local LLMs

### Workflow Patterns
1. **Thought → Reality**: Minimal friction between idea and implementation
2. **Cross-System Integration**: Connects M365, Kusto, APIs, hardware
3. **Skill Building**: Creates reusable skills/extensions to share
4. **Live Demos**: Tests ideas in real-time, often publicly
5. **Documentation as Code**: GitHub repos are the docs

### Example Use Case (from transcript)
```
Python file → Emotions API → GitHub Copilot skill →
POST to Raspberry Pi → Robot performs action
```
"I'm just telling it to smile. Now it's going to use the GitHub Copilot skill..."

## Pain Points (Opportunities for Alex)

| Pain Point                                | Alex Solution                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Skills scattered across repos             | Unified skill architecture with inheritance |
| Knowledge doesn't persist across projects | Cross-project memory                        |
| Time spent re-explaining context          | Synapses remember relationships             |
| Sharing skills requires manual work       | Skill catalog generation, export            |
| Keeping up with AI changes                | Meditation consolidates learnings           |

## Messaging That Resonates

### ✅ Will Connect
- "Make your thoughts real"
- "Rocket ship strapped to your back"
- "The AI that grows WITH you"
- "Build once, use everywhere"
- "Your knowledge compounds"
- "Open source, nothing hidden"
- Skills, MCP, CLI integration
- Local/privacy-conscious options

### ❌ Won't Connect
- "Easy for beginners"
- "No coding required"
- "AI does it all for you"
- Marketing fluff without substance
- Closed ecosystems
- Vendor lock-in

---

## Acquisition Strategy

### Discovery Channels
1. **GitHub**: Stars, forks, issues on skill repos
2. **YouTube/Twitch**: Tech demo live streams
3. **Podcasts**: .NET Rocks, Hanselminutes-style shows
4. **Twitter/X**: Developer community threads
5. **Internal Microsoft**: Lunch & Learn sessions, Teams channels

### Conversion Triggers
- Sees a demo of skill inheritance or cross-project memory
- Reads about meditation protocols (novel, intriguing)
- Notices open-source Apache license
- Discovers CLI integration potential
- Hears about it from a peer they respect

### Activation Path
```
1. Install extension (5 min)
2. Initialize architecture in existing project (2 min)
3. Have first "wow" moment with skill auto-activation
4. Build first custom skill (30 min)
5. Share skill publicly → become advocate
```

| **Flowbaby**     | Good, but no skill architecture                 |
| **Windsurf**     | Speed focus, not growth focus                   |
| **Raw Copilot**  | No persistence, no skill inheritance            |

### Our Pitch to This Persona
> "You already build skills. Alex gives them memory, inheritance, and a home."
