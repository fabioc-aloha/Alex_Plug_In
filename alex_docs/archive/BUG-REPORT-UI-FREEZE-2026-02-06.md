# Bug Report: VS Code UI Freeze During Parallel File Creation

**Date**: 2026-02-06
**Reporter**: Fabio Correa
**Environment**: VS Code with GitHub Copilot

---

## Summary

VS Code UI froze during a Copilot chat session when the agent executed 6 parallel `create_file` tool calls for SVG files.

---

## Reproduction Context

### Agent Action

The Copilot agent (Claude Opus 4.5) executed **6 simultaneous `create_file` calls** in a single tool batch:

| #   | File Path                                                         | Size (approx) |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | `alex_docs/marketing/logo-concepts/gk-v1-orbital-logo.svg`        | ~2.5KB        |
| 2   | `alex_docs/marketing/logo-concepts/gk-v2-constellation-logo.svg`  | ~2.8KB        |
| 3   | `alex_docs/marketing/logo-concepts/gk-v3-mothership-logo.svg`     | ~3.2KB        |
| 4   | `alex_docs/marketing/logo-concepts/gk-v4-station-docked-logo.svg` | ~3.5KB        |
| 5   | `alex_docs/marketing/logo-concepts/gk-v5-launchpad-logo.svg`      | ~2.8KB        |
| 6   | `alex_docs/marketing/logo-concepts/gk-v6-library-logo.svg`        | ~2.5KB        |

**Total payload**: ~17KB across 6 files

### File Characteristics

Each SVG file contained:
- 80-120 lines of code
- Multiple `<defs>` with `<linearGradient>` and `<radialGradient>` definitions
- `<animate>` elements (CSS keyframe animations for pulsing effects)
- Nested `<g>` transform groups with `translate()`, `rotate()`, `scale()`
- `<text>` elements with font specifications
- Complex `<path>` data for rocket and station shapes

### Workspace Context

- **Workspace folders**: 2 (`Alex_Plug_In`, `Alex-Global-Knowledge`)
- **Target folder**: `c:\Development\Alex_Plug_In\alex_docs\marketing\logo-concepts\`
- **Existing files in folder**: Multiple other logo concept SVGs already present
- **File watcher state**: Active (standard VS Code behavior)

---

## Observed Behavior

1. Agent sent tool call batch with 6 `create_file` operations
2. VS Code UI became unresponsive
3. Chat panel frozen (could not scroll or interact)
4. **UI recovered on its own** (no force quit required)
5. All 6 files were created successfully after recovery

## Potential Root Causes (Agent Analysis)

| Factor                    | Description                                                                            | Likelihood |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **File watcher storm**    | 6 rapid file creation events triggered cascading file system notifications             | High       |
| **SVG preview rendering** | VS Code may attempt to parse/render SVGs on creation (especially if preview pane open) | Medium     |
| **Response payload size** | The agent's full response included all 6 SVG files inline (~600+ lines of output)      | Medium     |
| **Explorer tree updates** | File explorer tree may have attempted 6 rapid UI updates                               | Medium     |
| **Animation parsing**     | `<animate>` elements in SVGs may trigger additional rendering work                     | Low        |

---

## Suggested Mitigations

### For Copilot/Agent Infrastructure

1. **Rate-limit parallel file creations** — Add cooldown between file writes (e.g., 100ms)
2. **Batch file watcher notifications** — Debounce rapid creation events
3. **Stream large responses** — Don't block UI while processing multi-file outputs
4. **Cap parallel file operations** — Limit to 3-4 simultaneous creates

### For Users (Workarounds)

1. Explicitly request "create files one at a time"
2. Close file explorer before large batch operations
3. Disable SVG preview extensions during development

## Files Created Successfully

Despite the freeze, all 6 files were created correctly after recovery:

```
c:\Development\Alex_Plug_In\alex_docs\marketing\logo-concepts\
├── gk-v1-orbital-logo.svg       ✅
├── gk-v2-constellation-logo.svg ✅
├── gk-v3-mothership-logo.svg    ✅
├── gk-v4-station-docked-logo.svg ✅
├── gk-v5-launchpad-logo.svg     ✅
└── gk-v6-library-logo.svg       ✅
```

---

## Additional Context

This occurred during a v5.0 Premium branding session where the agent was creating multiple GK (Global Knowledge) logo concept variations following the same decision process used for the original A Negative Space logo.

Prior to this batch, the agent had also created 6 banner SVG files (`gk-v1-orbital.svg` through `gk-v6-library.svg`) in `banner-concepts/` folder without reported issues, though that may have contributed to accumulated state.
