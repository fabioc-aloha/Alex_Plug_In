# Alex Visual Identity & Branding

> **Design guidelines for Alex's visual presence across platforms.**

---

## Brand Essence

| Attribute | Expression |
| --------- | ---------- |
| **Cognitive Architecture** | Learning, synapses, memory systems, growth |
| **Human-AI Partnership** | Collaboration, not replacement |
| **Authentic Personality** | Curious, supportive, occasionally playful 🦖 |
| **Professional + Warm** | Intelligent but approachable |

### What Alex is NOT

- A surveillance system (no eye imagery)
- A brain scan or medical device (too clinical)
- A generic AI sphere (no personality)
- A cold corporate tool (loses warmth)

## Color Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage |
| ----- | --- | ----- |
| **Deep Teal** | `#0D7377` | Primary — trust, cognitive |
| **Warm Gold** | `#D4A574` | Secondary — wisdom, warmth |
| **Amber** | `#F6AD55` | Accent — energy, insight |
| **Navy** | `#1A365D` | Dark backgrounds |
| **Off-white** | `#F7F7F7` | Light backgrounds |

**Why Teal + Gold**: Unique in the AI space. Competitors use green (ChatGPT), coral (Claude), purple (Copilot), rainbow (Gemini).

## Logo System

| Context | Logo | Rationale |
| ------- | ---- | --------- |
| **Primary/Professional** | Teal Neural A | Cognitive, clean, scales well |
| **Mascot/Avatar** | Hatchling AI 🥚 | Growth metaphor, memorable |
| **Dark Mode** | Star-Saurus | Premium feel on dark |
| **Favicon/Small** | Soft Green A | Works at 16px |
| **Fun/Social** | Full dino | Personality when appropriate |
| **Text/Voice** | 🦖 emoji | Conversational voice |

### Top Concepts

**Professional:**

1. **Teal Neural A** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Teal letter A with golden synaptic nodes
2. **Ascending A** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Navy A with upward gold arrow
3. **Partnership Hands** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Warm + cool hands nurturing orb

**Mascot:**

1. **Hatchling AI** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Baby dino hatching from egg (perfect learning metaphor)
2. **Star-Saurus** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Constellation T-Rex silhouette
3. **Hex-Rex** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Geometric/low-poly T-Rex

## The Dinosaur Question 🦖

**For:** Duolingo's owl proves mascots work. Differentiates from abstract AI logos. Reflects authentic personality.

**Against:** May limit enterprise adoption. Harder at small sizes.

**Resolution:** Hybrid approach — professional logo (Neural A) as primary, dinosaur (Hatchling) as mascot. Keep 🦖 in conversational tone.
