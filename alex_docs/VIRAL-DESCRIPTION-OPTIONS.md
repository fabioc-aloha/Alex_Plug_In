## Visual Communication

### Current Banner Analysis

**File**: `.github/assets/banner.svg`

| Element            | Current Implementation                                                                                  |

| **Primary Visual** | Neural network diagram (brain/nodes/synapses)                                                           |
| **Central Icon**   | Brain with memory nodes                                                                                 |

### Current Logo Analysis

**File**: `platforms/vscode-extension/assets/logo.svg`
**Brand**: CorreaX (C split X mark)

| Element       | Current Implementation                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Brand**     | **CorreaX** — the parent brand                   |
| **Symbol**    | C split X (partial circle + crossing chevrons)   |
| **Style**     | Geometric, minimalist, Microsoft design language |
| **Color**     | Azure blue gradient (#0078d4 → #005a9e)          |
| **Direction** | Right-pointing arrows (forward motion)           |
| **Size**      | 32x32 viewBox (icon-sized)                       |

**Brand Hierarchy:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           CorreaX                   │  ← Parent brand (logo)
│              ↓                      │
│            Alex                     │  ← Product name
│              ↓                      │
│   STRAP A ROCKET TO YOUR BACK       │  ← Positioning tagline
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Logo Interpretation:**
- C split X = CorreaX brand mark
- Arc (C) suggests growth/progress (partial → complete)
- Chevrons (X) suggest forward motion, speed
- Azure blue = Microsoft brand alignment
- Already has "forward momentum" built in

**Rocket Compatibility:**
| Aspect          | Logo Fit   | Notes                                  |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Forward motion  | ✅ GOOD     | Chevrons already point forward         |
| Speed/velocity  | ✅ GOOD     | Double arrow = acceleration            |
| Growth metaphor | ✅ GOOD     | Arc = incomplete → complete            |
| Rocket literal  | ⚠️ ABSTRACT | No literal rocket, but direction works |

**Recommendation**: Logo works well with rocket theme — already conveys forward momentum and speed. No changes needed for Phase 1.

### Theme Assessment: Brain vs Rocket

| Aspect              | Current (Brain)                | Rocket Theme                      | Fit            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Visual metaphor** | Neural network, organic growth | Propulsion, velocity, engineering | ⚠️ MISMATCH     |
| **Emotional tone**  | Scientific, academic           | Powerful, action-oriented         | ⚠️ DIFFERENT    |
| **Tagline**         | "Grows with you" (passive)     | "Strap a rocket" (active)         | ✅ UPDATABLE    |
| **Colors**          | Blue/green (cerebral)          | Blue/orange (fire/thrust)         | ⚠️ COULD UPDATE |
| **Skills badges**   | Generic capabilities           | "Boosters" framing                | ✅ RELABELABLE  |

### Reconciliation Options

**⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE: The brand name "Alex" must be prominently communicated in all assets.**

The rocket theme supports Alex — it doesn't replace it. Structure: **Alex** (brand) + **rocket metaphor** (positioning).

**Option 1: Full Rocket Rebrand**
- Replace neural network with rocket trail / launch pad
- Change brain icon to rocket icon
- Keep "Alex" title prominent (72px)
- Update subtitle: "Alex — Skill Engine for Builders"
- Update tagline: "STRAP A ROCKET TO YOUR BACK"
- Add orange accents for "fire" / thrust
- Rebrand skill badges as "boosters"

**Pros**: Full alignment with messaging
**Cons**: Loses brand recognition, significant design work

**Option 2: Hybrid — Brain + Rocket**
- Keep neural network (represents memory/skills)
- Add subtle rocket elements (thrust lines, trajectory)
- Keep "Alex" title prominent
- Update tagline only: "STRAP A ROCKET TO YOUR BACK"
- Keep VS Code blue, add subtle orange accents
- Frame: "Alex — Your brain, with a rocket attached"

**Pros**: Maintains existing identity, quicker to implement
**Cons**: Mixed metaphor

**Option 3: Tagline-Only Update (RECOMMENDED)**
- Keep current visual identity intact
- Keep "Alex" as hero title
- Update tagline: "STRAP A ROCKET TO YOUR BACK"
- Verbal messaging carries the rocket theme
- Visual stays cerebral/technical (appeals to developers)

**Pros**: Fastest to implement, "Alex" stays front and center
**Cons**: Not fully aligned visually

### Brand Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│              ALEX                   │  ← Hero brand (non-negotiable)
│     Skill Engine for Builders       │  ← Category descriptor
│  STRAP A ROCKET TO YOUR BACK        │  ← Positioning tagline
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

All copy should follow this hierarchy:
1. **Alex** — The name comes first
2. **What it is** — Skill engine / memory / architecture
3. **Rocket positioning** — The emotional hook

**Examples:**
- "Alex: Strap a rocket to your back"
- "Alex — 73 skills, rocket-fast"
- "Meet Alex. Your new rocket."

### Recommended Banner Changes

**Immediate (Text only):**
```
Keep:     "Alex" (hero title, 72px)
Current:  "THE AI THAT GROWS WITH YOU"
New:      "STRAP A ROCKET TO YOUR BACK"
```

**Phase 2 (If rocket theme sticks):**
- Add subtle thrust lines behind brain icon
- Add orange accent color for "fire" elements
- Update subtitle from "Multimodal Cognitive Architecture" to "Skill Engine for Builders"

### Color Palette Update (Phase 2)

| Element    | Current                | Rocket Update           |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Primary    | #007ACC (VS Code blue) | Keep                    |
| Accent     | #4CAF50 (growth green) | #f59e0b (thrust orange) |
| Background | Dark blue gradient     | Keep (space theme fits) |
| Fire/boost | N/A                    | #ef4444 (rocket red)    |

### Visual Assets Needed

| Asset                                | Status                | Priority                |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Updated banner with new tagline      | 🔴 Not started         | HIGH                    |
| Rocket icon variant                  | 🔴 Not started         | MEDIUM                  |

| Video thumbnail with rocket          | 🔴 Not started         | LOW                     |
| Dream state                          | Overnight maintenance | Automated consolidation |

## Competitive Positioning

| Extension    | Their Tagline                | Our Rocket Advantage                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Agent Memory | "Store and retrieve context" | We have boosters, not just fuel tanks |
| Flowbaby     | "No drift, no drama"         | We don't drift — we launch            |
| Windsurf     | "Type less. Code more."      | We don't type less — we fly           |

**Our position**: Alex — the only skill engine with propulsion, not just storage.

# Appendix: Marketing Guru Strategies

Reference framework for future copy iterations.

## Core Principles

### 1. Benefits Over Features (Rocket Edition)

| Feature              | Rocket Benefit           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 73 skills            | 73 pre-built boosters    |
| Cross-project memory | Fuel that never runs out |
| Skill inheritance    | Multi-stage propulsion   |
| Open source          | Inspect every component  |

**Rule**: Every feature needs a propulsion metaphor.

### 2. Headline Formula

```
[Rocket Action] + [Concrete Number] + [Open Source]
```

Examples:
- "Launch faster with 73 skills — open source"
- "Strap a rocket to your back — 73 boosters included"

### 3. The PAS Framework (Rocket Version)

```
Problem:  You're walking when you could be flying.
Agitate:  Every project, you start over. No momentum.
Solution: Strap a rocket to your back.
```

### 4. Social Proof Hierarchy

| Type                               | Credibility |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Testimonial with "rocket" language | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐       |
| GitHub stars / download count      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐        |
| "Used by engineers at [Company]"   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐        |
| Generic "developers love it"       | ⭐           |

### 5. CTA Variety (Rocket-Themed)

- "Launch now" → Install link
- "See the boosters" → Skill catalog
- "Inspect the components" → GitHub repo
- "Watch the launch" → Demo video

### 6. Subject Line Formulas

| Formula             | Example                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Reference Hanselman | "The rocket strap you mentioned" |
| Number + Rocket     | "73 boosters, open source"       |
| Action              | "Launch faster"                  |
| Curiosity           | "Stop walking. Start flying."    |

### 7. Copy Length Rules

| Context           | Ideal Length |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| Twitter DM        | < 200 chars  |
| Cold email        | < 100 words  |
| Marketplace short | ~150 chars   |
| Marketplace long  | 6-8 lines    |

**Rule**: If it takes more than 3 seconds to scan, add more thrust.

---

## Quick Reference: Rocket Phrases

Keep using these:
- "Strap a rocket to your back"
- "Launch faster"
- "Pre-built boosters"
- "No refueling between launches"
- "Inspect every component"
- "Stop walking. Start flying."
- "73 skills"

Avoid overusing:
- "Rocket ship" (slightly childish — use "rocket")
- "Blast off" (too playful)
- "To the moon" (crypto baggage)
