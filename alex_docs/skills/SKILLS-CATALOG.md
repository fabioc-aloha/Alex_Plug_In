## Trifecta Coverage

A **trifecta** is a capability encoded across all three memory systems:
- **Skill** (SKILL.md) — Declarative domain patterns
- **Instruction** (.instructions.md) — Procedural workflows
- **Prompt** (.prompt.md) — Interactive episodic guides

Muscles (.github/muscles/) are execution scripts, NOT a trifecta component.

## Adding New Skills

1. Create folder: `.github/skills/[skill-name]/`
2. Add `SKILL.md` with:
   - Frontmatter `applyTo` patterns
   - Staleness warning (if tech-dependent)
   - Core content
   - Synapses reference
3. Add `synapses.json` with:
   - skill name
   - inheritance value
   - connections to other skills
   - trigger keywords
4. Update this catalog
5. Update `copilot-instructions.md` skills list

## Skill Quality Checklist

- [ ] Purpose is clear in first line
- [ ] Content is terse (for AI, not humans)
- [ ] Examples are concrete
- [ ] Anti-patterns noted
- [ ] Connections mapped in synapses.json
- [ ] Staleness warning if needed
- [ ] Triggers defined for activation
