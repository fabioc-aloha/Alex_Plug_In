## Post-Flight

- [ ] No console errors: Help → Toggle Developer Tools → Console tab
- [ ] Extension loads without warnings in Output → Alex Cognitive Architecture
- [ ] All sections passing? → Mark DoD criterion #4 complete
- [ ] Ready to publish to marketplace

## Installation Commands

```powershell
# From project root
cd platforms/vscode-extension

# Build and package (creates .vsix in platforms/vscode-extension/)
npm run compile
npx @vscode/vsce package

# Install locally (replace existing version)
code --install-extension alex-cognitive-architecture-5.7.1.vsix --force

# Restart VS Code, then test
```

## Discrepancy Notes (Fix During Sweep)

- [x] **LM tools count**: ~~Active Context says "8 LM tools" but package.json declares **12**~~ — **FIXED** in copilot-instructions.md
- [ ] **Chat avatar WebP**: If VS Code doesn't support `.webp` for `ChatParticipant.iconPath`, fall back to `.png`
- [ ] **AGE_TIERS boundary**: 2 skills → Newborn? Or Toddler? Verify edge case at exactly 3 skills
