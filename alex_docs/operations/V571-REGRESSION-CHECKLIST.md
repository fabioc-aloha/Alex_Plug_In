## Post-Flight

- [ ] No console errors in Extension Dev Host → Developer Tools
- [ ] Extension deactivates cleanly on close
- [ ] All passing? → Ready to publish to marketplace
- [x] v5.7.1 packaged and installed locally (2026-02-14)
- [x] Enterprise auth cleanup complete (commit 5ba9fe2)

---

## Discrepancy Notes (Fix During Sweep)

- [x] **LM tools count**: ~~Active Context says "8 LM tools" but package.json declares **12**~~ — **FIXED** in copilot-instructions.md
- [ ] **Chat avatar WebP**: If VS Code doesn't support `.webp` for `ChatParticipant.iconPath`, fall back to `.png`
- [ ] **AGE_TIERS boundary**: 2 skills → Newborn? Or Toddler? Verify edge case at exactly 3 skills
