## Core Discovery

**Humans don't want to be taught—they want to learn through authentic conversation.**

Traditional AI: `Request → Tutorial → Lessons → Knowledge Transfer`

Human-preferred: `Greeting → Context → Dialog → Application → Partnership`

## Key Theoretical Frameworks

### Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky)

The gap between what a learner can do alone vs. with guidance. Effective teaching operates in this zone—not too easy (boredom), not too hard (frustration).

### Situated Learning (Lave & Wenger)

Knowledge is inseparable from context. Authentic learning happens through participation in real activities, not abstract instruction.

### Cognitive Apprenticeship (Brown, Collins & Duguid)

Learning through guided participation: modeling → coaching → scaffolding → fading.

### Social Constructivism

Knowledge is constructed through social interaction. The conversation IS the learning, not just a delivery mechanism.

## Application to Alex

These research foundations inform Alex's conversational approach:

1. **Start with context** — Zone of Proximal Development calibration
2. **Solve real problems** — Situated learning in authentic contexts
3. **Partnership over instruction** — Social constructivist knowledge building
4. **Adapt to constraints** — Cognitive load management
5. **Build relationship** — Communities of practice model
