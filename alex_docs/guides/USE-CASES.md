## 💡 Tips for Non-Development Projects

1. **Use Markdown** — VS Code excels at Markdown editing. Most writing projects work beautifully in `.md` files.

2. **Leverage Extensions** — Install extensions for your domain:
   - Writers: Markdown preview, word count, Hemingway-style analysis
   - Researchers: Citation managers, bibliography tools
   - Managers: Gantt charts, kanban boards

3. **Structure for Learning** — The folder structure isn't just organization—it's how Alex understands your project. Meaningful folders help Alex provide better support.

4. **Capture Insights Early** — Don't wait for meditation. When you learn something valuable, tell Alex immediately.

5. **Review Knowledge Periodically** — Use `/knowledge` to see what Alex has learned. Curate and correct as needed.
